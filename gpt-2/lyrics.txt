[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

[Verse 1]
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

Let's make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking
Words get drowned out by the sound
Let's get back to touching and we'll get back on solid ground

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day, love?
We can lose control, baby don't say no
Heaven only knows

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

[Bridge]
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance

[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

We gon' kill the stigma up
Huxtables turned to Obamas
It ain't about where you been, where you from
What you got
It’s all about love
Self-love is the best love (Love)
When you gon' take that wristband off? (Off)
That pity party been over (Been over)
Don't need make-up to dress you up (Dress you up)

Just me, Iman, and headphone cords

I live in abundance, love is the new money
I’m mentally wealthy, spiritually conscious
I’m fresh out of Onyx, I'm ballin’, I'm ballin'
I play with the hunnids, love is the new money
That's my frequency, stock up, burn the sage
Clear the room, heal the hate, love is the new wave

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
The value is internal
Your value is internal




Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna bee

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)

She said she wants some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)

I told her to drive over in her new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip
Then I want you to strip

Then you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin'
Callin' me Biggie like Shyne home

Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones

She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For the World, she was ready for some action
My dawg said, "You ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong."

I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get it right

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right

Got you lookin' at the gliss, at my hands and wrists
While I'm likely at smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' original like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain' no messin' with Kan-man and Twist

From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy
Twistin A-marie
Try'na Smoke a B
Lookin' properly
Feelin' on a G
And always (well, well, well, well)

Come with me and sip on some regular champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving, so I'm bumpin' a little Spinners

While I'm smokin' On a B
Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got to leave
On the 23's
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let my get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze For Maze
Fulfilling our every sensation, slow jammin', having deep sex

You Ready For the World girl
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controllin' me, I'm lovin' the way you be
Holding me when I been listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone
Just to get you goin'
Try'na make you moan
And I do it (well, well, well, well)




[Intro: Father's Children]
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Yo!)

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Outro: Father's Children]
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend – well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Outro]
On and on and on and on
And on and... and on and on and on

How many people came with the one they love tonight?
Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?

Yeah I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I can make the way to heaven tonight
Don't listen to me baby cause I'm an asshole
And you always find, yeah you always find
Yeah I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I won every single bill 'bout you every minute I had to
Don't listen to me cause I'm an asshole
And you always found and the one place I fucked up
I thought you'd always be mine, I thought you'd always be mine
I thought you'd always be mine and if I say I didn't love you, I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying

[Bridge]
So do me a favor

[Chorus]
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight

And drive my two-seaters and hold my heaters
You look so good, you make me want to say (na, na na na)
.Baby don't you know I need ya
I want you to be my ghetto señorita
And drive my two-seaters and hold my heaters
Matter of fact, take this ring I promise I'll never leave you

[Verse 1: ?]
Christina the next Diva; Dope like reefer
Flow sicker than fever hold two heaters
Roll in a two seater chicks like me-a
Get off the meter, yeah I put my feet up
Nigga follow the leader or get off my ???

Haters with my tape be like "Oh you a cheater"
Here we go again, real foes in my beeper
She getting married man, man told her he bout to leave her
I'm too hot to feed her, two shots of 'grita
Somebody tell her to ease up when ???
Six-Double O, shit gives you seizures

[Kanye West]
Yo Scratch she said, "Yo, I love this beat
But I know he ain't make them sounds with his mouth."
I said, "How you gonna doubt this man?
He got a Grammy for beat boxin' for Christ sake."
How you gonna doubt this man. You know what she said? She said...

[Hook]
Now I'm ready to go (go)
So let me grab my coat (coat)
And then we're out the door (door)
I ain't no ho but I can get low

[Kanye West]
She said, oooh that's my favorite part
Oooh a Ferrari that's my favorite car
The-the-The Roc, them my favorite stars
And I love the way they blaze the charts
But how she gonna play your man?
Act like she ain't know who the hell I am
Or act like she ain't know the jets I land
In Ireland
I let her eye the rims cause she admire them
That goofy that you're running with
I can buy your man
Pause
I ain't trippin'
I don't lie to fans
Y'all
Will soon see how them lames will do you
His name Raymond but he weaker than Raymond (Ramon) noodles
Now she's Grindin'
Throwin' it back like Nolan Ryan
Get it?
She said that ooooh
Really turns me on
So yoooooo
Need to take me home

[Hook] - x2

[Kanye West]
She said ooh this my favorite verse
I knew she kinda bright when she reached in her purse
I said, "Girl you know you freaky, obey your thirst"
It's one o'clock and I'm way past first
And though Jay is killin' girl like O.J
That's why haters want to jack son (Jackson) for his Ice Cubes like O'Shea
They keep a lemon face like they sippin' on Ocean Spray
We toast and say, "We made it to the post Jay"
Send a couple models this way
With their disposable camera they wanna pose with K
Money got me smellin' sweater then Potpurri
Not gonna flow today
I need a whole parade
Fuck that I need a whole brigade
Of girls still rockin' Poetic Justice braids
Just to say, "You O.K. Player, but you no K
But I will give you my number if you know K

[Hook] - x2

[Consequence]
Eww, I'm still kinda stressed
I'm tryin' to climb in your dress
I see you recline in the rest
But my time is pressed
If you tryin' to step
Come holla at your boy, yo I'm one of the next
She said, "You
Gonna have to wait around a minute
Cause my hair ain't done and my nails ain't finished
It's the things that you love
So I need five minutes"
But five turned into twenty
Twenty turned into forty
Give her five minutes and I'm out on shorty
Chill
"Why you leavin'
Tired of the lonely nights and the quiet evenings
Plus I've been horny the entire evening"
True
Uh, now you're talkin'
In front of the telly and now I'm parkin'
But now she got an attitude and now she barkin'
So ooooh
Now she walkin' uh

[Hook]

Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed

[Verse 1]
When you read my mind, get down and discover me
I'm an open door, let you come inside of me
Want to put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget

Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]

And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh my god, let me clean your wound
I can be your nurse, got the antidote

Can you be my father? Tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]

Blindfolds, stringer pearls
Neckties, silk scarf
Silver chains, pretty girls

High heels, golden mask

Absinthe, novocaine
Chopsticks, underwear
Bar of soap, dental chair
Fishnets, satin sheets

Leather belt, meat stove
Golden shower, latex thong
Licorice whip, strap it on

Sex




[Verse 1]
Pullin' up in that new toy
The wrist on that boy rockstar like Pink Floyd
Waving at rude boy, I'm wavin' at you, boy
Ran off on the plug too like Trugoy
Imagine me do-boy, you could never do what I do, boy
Still, duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy; ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago – if you know, you know (Yeah)

[Break]
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

[Verse 2]
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

[Verse 3]
You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to weigh, "Do you war or wait?"
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
(If you know, you know)
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
I've been hidin' where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle 'round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)




[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Bridge]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true
Mama mama mama mama mama...
Mama mama mama mama mama...

[Verse 1]
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for heaven’s sakes, huh
Well I’mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

[Verse 2]
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

[Verse 3]
One day I’m gon' marry a porn star
We’ll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her, they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Bridge]
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on
With the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck- Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on

[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

[Outro]
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That’s one hell of a life

(Mmm, mmm, mmm)




[Intro]
We got the remix
It's another hot exclusive from the dominators

[Hook: Connie Mitchell + Dwele]
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
What do I know?
Flashing lights, lights
Know

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Pharmaceuticals bought me charm like the jeweler jewels
Squares of ice shed light like the Rubix cube
I get it mixed up, red with the blues
And she all mixed up, admirin' the hues
Four years later, niggas admirin' your shoes
Bape year late, we call you Tokyo buffoons
'Cause stylists admire us, look at how you groom
Keep runnin' to SoHo, them exclusives in my room
Niggas is biters, we let you slide with your writings
We knew that cocaine talk was not like you
But who goes as far as tryin' to dress like him?
One sequin glove can never make you Michael
I moonwalk over tracks and make niggas spiteful
But never hear a word 'cause them niggas know
That my flow so viper and if Pusha go psycho
He'll seance that pen and pull your spirit up out yah, P

[Verse 2: No Malice]
I'm so literary with it, you can tell how I write
The boy such an author, I should smoke a pipe
Rockin' an ascot, the coupe with a glass top
17 inch rims makin' the ass drop
I was in the spot from the first to the fifth
With a mean comeback like The Return of the Sith
Like ridin' a bike, never you forget
Still I got it for cheap, whether you smoke or you sniff
The gift is the curse and vice versa
To remove me off that horse takes more than a merger
Durin' that hiatus I was with the natives
Then back to the States, pass along the savings
Put it in the street, caterin' the cravings
Like the second-comin', got the fans awaitin'
Victory is sweet, even amongst the hatin'
Find me on that beach, island in the Caymans, gone

[Hook: Dwele + Connie Mitchell]
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know?
Flashing lights, lights
What do you know?
Flashing lights, lights
Know...
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Outro: DJ Drama]
What up, you know who it is, it's the one and only Mr. Thanksgiving a.k.a. Mr. Gangsta Grillz himself, DJ Drama. And right now you're locked into Benzy's Get Right Radio. Pay attention!

If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything

Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get ya own
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get ya own

[Verse 3: Fergie, Rihanna & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Chorus: Choir]
Turn up the lights in here, baby

You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Elton John]
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1: GHos Heru]
Blank my brother I been fucking him for years

Don’t look at me weird this shit is normal
Catch me at a formal giving him oral
My flow is tight like my anus, till blank got it
I’m all about that sack like some bank robbers
Ayo

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
All this Black history running in the family
Went and hopped in a Rolls you in a Camry
Black faces like the ones I love to skeet on
No misses or missy the way I get my freak on
I love fucking men if my wife ain’t at home
I’m a dog and to me that dick is a bone
I don’t fuck with Solange, she found out my secret
She caught me fucking Ye while I was indecent

All I wanna know
Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel

[Verse Two]
Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong when it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed? (Huh huh huh)
Can't a girl from the hood find a homey
That ain't just tryin' to hang around me?
Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me
Every time he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to settle for a cap back K-Swiss stroke his ego?
(Mmh girl no)
Can't a chick from the hood find a homey
That wanna do more than spend money on me?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Why is it so hard
For a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
Why is it so hard
For a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
I just gotta know

Tell me if it's new or old, tell me if it's hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold, say, "Ludacris, 6 million sold"
See I ain't got no time for games, and I ain't got no time for lames

YO! I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)

[Verse 3: Trina]
Diamond Princess, just mind your business
These rumors are senseless, your whispers are endless
We living ghetto fab, we spending hella cash
This girl is hella bad, your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores, you saw me grace The Source
You watched me work the Vibe, bitches, I works for mine
One time for these divas, two times for these Visas
Third time I come, I'm breezing, the ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up, I'ma keep it going back to back, I'ma keep on blowing
Platinum plaques, keeping it hood, wet sex, keeping it good
Look, girl, you don't know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas will slow your roll, pussy power, we in control

[Hook: Trina (Ludacris)]
YO! I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)

I got a mess that can't be mopped up
Chilling with my girl and guess who popped up
A chick from the road that says she's knocked up
Next thing I know your boy's locked up
Cause the one I rocked up is worse than upset
Wish I could take it back, reverse the blood test
Cause I was in the hood getting hooptie love
Till I hit the road and groupie love
Stacked all my paper got a crew with dubs
Now I'm the one that all the groupie's love
But how I'mma tell my secret to a pillow talker?
That's too caught up and she's still a stalker
My days are darker
Fate is altered
And me and baby girl ain't make the alter
But after all of that I done learned my lessons
Matter of fact, these are my confessions

[Chorus: Usher]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way

Met her on tour

You don't realize, you just made a ghetto girl's dreams
She don't need a ring cause she got you till he 18
And I know you want to know, was there room in them jeans
And you get ass so I won't assume you was fiendin'
But these girls is genius's, we thinking with our penis's
In my opinion, that's when they take us to the cleaners

[Chorus: Usher]

Almost cried, but I'mma player so I do how I do it. I'm GLC. Hood Celebrity, know what I'm talkin' bout?

[Verse 4: GLC]
Baby I was broke and I was pimping 'em girl
She gave me her world and I ain't give her nothin'
I knew she was frontin'
You can ask for real, I'm GLC, I get it how I live
Weight on my shoulders like the Man Of Steel
I get it like a champ, I ran through her camp
I only hit her cause you wasn't there
Baby where was you at?
She bought me some sounds, bought me an ounce
I ain't bought nothing, I ain't high or nothin'
Last time you said I was trying to hit your cousin
Until I told you I wasn't
Baby I'm sorry for the pain impression
Let me replace it with pleasure
If you gon' cry don't ask them questions
Let's listen to Usher, that's my confession

[Kanye West]
Hello Ladies and Gentlemen

You know I never say the dates but since this is a mixtape

Are y’all all ready for this ride?
Are you all ready for the ride?
I’ma stop playing with they emotions
Plain Pat, let’s go




[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Yo, I did some things but that's the old me
Now you wanna keep me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend; I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why does she be so mad at me for?
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talkin', talkin', talkin' tall
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
You just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
So imma take off tonight
Into the night

[Chorus]
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so...
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?




[Intro]
But I could give a damn what they say
I could give a damn about the things that they say
I could give a damn about the things that they say
I could give a...you know why? 'Cause...

[Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(Come on)
They say, They say...
They don't know
(Y'all know what they say, right? You know what they say)

[Verse 1: Common]
Yo, they say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derek, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
Richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yeah, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit' focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

[Chorus]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(Come on)
They say, They say...
They don't know

[Verse 2: Common]
They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen "The Corner", now they say "That nigga's back"




[Hook]
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve

[Verse 1]
This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided, if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

[Hook]
But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

[Verse 2]
Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For 11 years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress

[Hook]
'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!

[Verse 3]
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference 'tween me and Hova

[Hook]
But I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!




[Verse 1: Madonna & Natalia Kills]
I can give you everything that you want
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
You can't buy this at no luxury store
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Madonna]
There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Verse 2: Madonna & Natalia Kills]
I can teach you all the things you don't know
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
It's rare like mink, it's something you wanna own
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven’s door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Bridge: Madonna]
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
If you like it, please confess
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best

[Interlude: "Vogue" Sample]
Ladies with an attitude
Don't just stand there
Don't-don't, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothin' to it

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven's door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Outro: Madonna]
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Do-don't it taste like holy water?
Yeezus loves my pussy best




[Intro]
You like to ride, uh
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
Would you like to ride?
I don't know what happened, it's just like
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two Gs
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh, you so boozy, boo, you could've fooled me
'cause five years ago, you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery, ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Robin Geeda
Then I'ma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

[Chorus]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade?
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things, let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?

[Verse 2: Malik Yusef]
Malik Yusef, bet your baby, momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words, spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you, fuck it
Now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to?

[Chorus]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade?
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things, let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?

[Verse 3: Common]
Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife, stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction, so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways
Goin' wild like West and Kanye
Wherever I lay my [unverified] is my home
Goddamnit, I'm grown
Broke broad, I'ma leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

[Chorus]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things, let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things, let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends?

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1]
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 2]
We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work, baby?"
Well, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe, I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends"
On the phone, hollin' that "Niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress"
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far"
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh




[Verse 1: Drake]
Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I’m the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame, I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho, I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Burgundy y'all the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit and guess what it’s true bitch

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

[Refrain: Drake, Big Sean]
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
It's so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ay look, I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)
I’m just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I’m the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I’m who they going ape shit over
I’m who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money’s over all
I’m tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can’t stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I’m living everyday month yearly
Yell until you muthfuckers hear me, we made it

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

Twenty K yeah, don't play
Put twenty K on a nigga face, yesterday
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now that nigga had a funeral, oh man
Oh man, oh man, I put in them bands
You don't understand
You don't wanna play with me
Don't tarnish my name
'Cause I did this not for the fame, I did this for the ice
And I did this for the price
If a nigga right price, I'll take your life
Yeah, for the right price, I'll take your life, yeah
For the right price, hey, yeah, for the right price
(Get it, keep it)

On your job, all workin it out

Around the way, comin straight out the house
You just laid on the couch
Make a cat just pause and be "Wow"

[Talib Kweli]
Baby's body was immaculate
Sweet like my first kiss in the back of the flick
I have to insist, miss, that we chat for a bit
But your ass wanna diss
Walkin all fast like you can't stop

You just assume that I be on that supermasculine *shit*
Crackin the whip just to shut you you and fasten your lip

[Intro: Future]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin' in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, baby girl, gold chains

[Chorus: Future]
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing
Getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel the same
We the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Eighteen-wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money, screaming, "Encore!"
Spending nights with a prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac, Above the Rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
'Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the Feds knock at your door

[Chorus: Future]
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain
Yuugh! This is drug dealer brilliance

[Drum break]

[Verse 2 (Cont'd): Pusha-T]
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'caine
Push: my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Trey-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
But instead, I chose Avon
Powder-face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup (woo!)
It's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message

[Chorus: Future]
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring




[Intro: Kanye]
This is a story about uh ballers and players the same shit but uh

And figure shes getting the stacks
Figuring that we run clean like hoes and me

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm that kind of girl
Who loves her diamonds and white pearls
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa-oh
So tempt me
To jetset away in London, to sip on some tea
You surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ohhh (la la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"
So let's run away, let's run away, way-way
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I remember, when the pilot closed the door
He said, "It's time for lift-off"
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"
Don't ever wonder, cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top, you'll never question why you left
Ohh, my world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away, let's run away!
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen, baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is

[Chorus: John Legend & Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby, it's as good as it gets (kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss




[Intro: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life
Mm, mm
Mm-mm

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they compe-tation
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man (Uh-huh), no snitchin' man (Uh-uh)
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave, 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas (Errr!)
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have no more
Uh, well, Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn, Kanye! (Kanye! Kanye!)
Now hold up! Ain't nobody messin' with me, dog
Now, you say it! ("Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!")
I told dude, "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
("When the album comin' out?") Man, the people is askin'
Yamamoto Adidas is sick with the fashion
Y'all already got dough so you spit for the passion
The way you rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man
Nope, nope, let's not do that, man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
And got the whole world shakin' just like crack fiends

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters, fo' life (Woo!)
Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Just let the beat ride out for a minute

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Let's take it there, take it there, man
Champ 'posed to be what you see
The People's Champ, you ugly
GLC, where you at homie?

[Verse 2: GLC]
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights out
After the sunshine, you thinkin' it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments
Dre got shot (Ugh) and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashin' (Ha!)
You ain't got no muscles, you weakling bastard (Haha)
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks!
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah (Uh, uh, uh)
And offers to sell and yell, uh

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life
Roc-A-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
That you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you, got to
Love you, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost in... my doubt

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly so high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost and found out (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) the fuckin' wolves"




[Samuel Christian]
You ready?

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, L.A.C

[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks

[Hook: Samuel Christian]
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not want for an-y-thing
I swear this though

[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time

[Hook]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm tipsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar, my spice
My base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...

[Hook] - repeat until fade

[Chorus: John Legend]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye
Let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break, next to the "No Smoking" sign
With a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writing my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle, you can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude, lock yourself in a room
Doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!"
So many records in my basement
I'm just waiting on my spaceship

[Chorus: John Legend]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob, at the same time
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Life my love, that's not mine
"Why you ain't signed?" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall
Got to get mine, got to take mine
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime
Got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves, waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope
Holler at God, "Man why'd you have to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people counting on me
And I'm just trying to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!
(Aww, man, this pressure)

[Chorus: John Legend]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I remember having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Trying to make this thing right
And having one of my co-workers say "Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

[Chorus: John Legend]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Outro: Tony Williams]
I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me, brother, for a ride

(Bonjour) I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (bonjour)
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (bonjour)
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket
A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor
Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door

Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes

Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour)
Come through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches

Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business
She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness

Vacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it
Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour)
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours
All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute
If we don't invest it—we long-term affected
Watch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin'
I got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'
Flexin'

[Verse 4: The World Famous Tony Williams]
My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', "What did I do?" (bonjour)
She looked at me like, "Damn, did I surprise you?"
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked back down the avenue (bonjour)
She's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour)
I'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour)

[Outro: The World Famous Tony Williams]
(Oooh oooh la la, oui-oui amour)
She be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum
She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe
In that white gown that I be seein' right through
Crowd obscurin' my view
There's nothin' left to argue (bonjour)
At least there's not from my view (bonjour)




[Kweli talking]
Yeah
Yeah! That's what I'm talkin about!
Let's do it... Kanye West, c'mon turn me up and
Black Thought, c'mon turn me up and
Pharoahe Monch, c'mon turn me up and
Talib Kweli in the house with

[Hook: Kanye West]
Guerrilla Monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat

[Black Thought]
Yo, I hit these emcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of "ifs" an "ands", it's just straight talkin
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin off more than you can chew, create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin nails into they own coffins (c'mon)
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket-launchin (yeah)
Black Thought, quit playin him close and back up off him

[Talib Kweli]
Kweli -- spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
The real emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D - my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin me
I black and blue emcees - actin new to me, get smacked stupidly
They lack skills, like the black community lack unity (uh)
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz'
Step off the stage to shouts of "Kweli boomayyay!!"

[Pharoahe Monch]
See these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
Nigga YOU, got ta, understand the plot ta
Movin and groovin and always improvin alot-ta
I'll outfox the, average Porsche Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra (New York...)
Slash Chi-Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly

[Hook: Kanye West]
Guerrilla Monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat

[Black Thought]
Okay... my sound drenches, each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan nigga competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin Pharoahe for help

[Talib Kweli]
From natives walkin the Trail of Tears to players sippin Belvedere
We always comin well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin fear
PLUS, even my niggas from the Bay, they say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well-aware
Your style - under-developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi, sayin ya crew blazin
Like sayin Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin

[Pharoahe Monch]
Guerrilla Monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed-spittin contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed - cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats

[Hook: Kanye West]
Guerrilla Monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at 'em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives
Like UPN
It's real people

[Outro]
Yeah
For you and yours
G.O.O.D. Music
Forever
Yeah
Rock on
We keep on
Uh.. Yeah
Yeah, yeah
The real...




[Intro: Mos Def + (Sample)]
(Let the sun shine)
Yeah yeah its a brand new day y'all (Let the sunshine in)
Turn me up in the top a little bit dog
Little do you know, y'all gonna hear this one (The suns shinin')
Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen..

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you motherfuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dog, Not to def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not the dude
I'm grown man business, and I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin' this is not for you
On my J.O. with beats by Kan-ye yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low

[Hook 1: Mos Def + (Sample)]
(Let the sun shine)
Standing in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am, Black Dante (Let the sunshine in)
That nigga, that dude
Black People, Lets Move (The suns shinin')
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli, yes
We on top-a top-a, shout-a shout-a
Check it out..

[Verse 2: Mos Def + (Sample)]
Slim nigga that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim, and more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, hail Mary, full of grace
Niggas come in and shoot up the place
And make you pull up your face
The deck, I'm a pull out the ace
From the jungles of the empire state
Where it ain't no escape, 247, 718
And thats like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the states, I'm collecting my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised

[Hook 2: Mos Def + (Sample)]
(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understanding me straight (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
Its what it is, what it is
And thats what it is, you see? (The suns shinin')
Ha, Fire..

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn it don't matter if you holler or whisper
Your coming through clear, cause I'm right here wit'cha
Ain't gotta edit your slang, I got it, I get ya
Yo, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time that you get where I'm standing, I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move wrong

[Outro: Mos Def + (Sample)]
(Let the sun shine)
I move in, and y'all must move on
Cause I'm oh too strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)
Made it go without a brand new car
I was fresh without a brand new song
Don't give a fuck about what brand you are (The suns shining')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family y'all
No matter where your families are
Cause everybody needs family y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me y'all
Everybody needs family y'all
Be good to your families dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody needs family dog
Raise a hand, you understand me pa
Thats what it is...thats my man
Family and my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those who still in the struggle
Assata, Mumia, Sundiata, my man Jamil
(Let the sun shine)
Life is real
To all the real soldiers, black people (Let the sunshine in)
We family y'all (The suns shining')
Let it be bright..




[Kanye West - talking]

[Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga I control the gold
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around hoes before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no
No means no just as sure as green means go, green means paper
Dream team, caper we see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people, come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

[Hook x1]

[White Boy]
White Boy back in the mix, and I'm in the atmosphere
Crunkin' for stackin' the fifth, and we got them gats in here
This is not a game, Cris is not a lame
Chi-town drop the flame, White Boy got them thangs
White Boy a hot damn shame, White Boy hot like mars
Y'alls flow hot like March, y'all can't stop these bars
White Boy drop these charts, White Boy got the ball
Lyrics gon' shock you all, Cris gon' cop them cars
Get a couple foxy broads, out they shoes socks and bra
This is not so hard, Cris got a rocky heart
Pimp wit' a monster walk, Cris got hostile thoughts
Y'all better watch it dawg, me and West rock you dawg

[Hook 2x]

[White Boy]
Rap profit, plat gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat
Pockets mac, hopin' crack, poppin' stacks
Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, opt-Yeah
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
Need ya way, from this place, cause it ain't common (nope)
If this ain't the way, Kan-ye, then it's straight
Colleges, in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for the next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

[Hook 2x]




State Property Music

Bitch outta line -
Ho been drove me outta my mind
She like, I shoulda knew before I lay down and slept with him (slept with him)
Now she wish that she could sleep with him (sleep with him)
Take a stroll with him
Wanna creep with him (with him)
Roll with him (with him)
And turn to a freak on him
Ain't have no patience with him when the ceilin leaked on him
Creeped on him

From the bed to the tub, bathtub to the ceilin
Killin' the world... holla!!

[Verse 2: Freeway]
I ain't Big but scrap you dead wrong
Ya'll coulda scrapped it out
He was never known for shootin' the toola packin' the chrome
He was known for shootin' the hoops up
Little hustle nigga grind (grind)
To get his jeans and boots up
At the summer league game D game rough
And the summer heat had ya'll niggas feelin' like ya'll so damn tough
Wrong words, couple of shoves, park full of hoes
Had his hands all in your mug
How could you roll with pride in your way
You drove with your .38 to the place where he stay
Said, "say hi to the pearly gates and scrolls."
Now I pop beers reminisce with your bro
You can't make it to the show
And niggas make it to the jail
Shed a tear

[Hook: Freeway]
When you hear the song
Will you cry (it's fucked up man)
Cause you know you wrong(how you go out then you locked up)

Will you cry (I ain't forget about you ol' girl, I remember)

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Oh look

You know this nigga ain't kiddin'
Think harder, Freeway L. Pridgen
Shit you used to tell me make me wanna work harder
At gettin' crack spots sent me to prison
Said I'm never gonna be a thang
So I listened and skipped school
Had them thing distributed
Fuck class, on the block all day
My science was choppin', baggin', dividin', addin', the math
How my teacher gonna tell me I'm dumb
Had me feelin' like a sore thumb
Clown of the class (uh)
I got graded most hated with guns
But now I made it to the life
Couldn't make it to the class
If this nigga chew your ear
That's an oh for you to hear
Kiss my ass!

[Hook: Freeway]

Diamonds, darlin'
(Christina)

(Kanye)
Aye, aye
Uh
You love my diamonds, don't you?
Love the way a nigga shine, don't chu?
Baby what's your disposition
Have you ever tried dis position?
You my dream girl
From the poster's that I thought I'd never get a close to

In a black limousine with chauffeurs
Right next to the testerosas
It's funny how all the jewelry
Just get your cat so furry
They look so good all together
They say they are forever

You love my diamonds, don't cha
That I bought from all this rhyming
But I know you'll never love me
You'll only love my diamonds

(Christina)
You pick me up on a hot summer night
I fall in love with you multiple times
Got me wrapped around your finger
Boy, I hope your love lingers
(I doo I doo)

You're my one and only rock in the rough
I like to floss you, baby
You light me up
And there ain't no way I give you away
He's my d-d-diamond daddy and I just gotta have him

When I love you, baby
I wanna love you just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shinning
Diamonds, Diamonds

I'll treasure you, cherish you
Where you on my body, ooh
Cause we go together like diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby
Oh
And I love you like my diamonds
I do

Like every girl
I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls and big raft diamond rings
But you're my precious possession
I'd rock you 24/7
(I doo... I doo..)

All my accessories
I'd give them up
(Yeah, just like you)
On eBay
Trade them in for your love
(That's what I'd do.)
There ain't no way
I'm giving you away
You're my diamond daddy and I gotta have you

When I love you, baby
I wanna love you just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining
Diamonds, diamonds
I'll treasure you, cherish you
Where you on my body, ooh

'Cause we go together
Like diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby
Oh
And I love you like my diamonds
I do

You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad you're mind
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad you're mind
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

When I love you, baby
I wanna love you just like I love my diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds)
And when I wear you out at night, boy
Yeah, we'll be shining
(Diamonds, diamonds.)

I'll treasure you, cherish you
Where you on my body oooh
'Cause we go together
Like diamonds are forever
You're my ice blue baby
Oh
And I love you like my diamonds
I do
(Diamonds, diamonds.)




[Produced by Kanye West & Zaytoven]

[Intro]
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
All a nigga hear is my chains clinkin' back and forth right now, nigga
Yeah, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched a bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the co-defendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

[Verse]
Hit Sin City and syndicate it
All the time on the strip in Vegas
I got the juice but I ain't Minute Maid it
But a nigga made it just minutes later
Shut the fuck and let me finish, baby
I'll let you finish later
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Yeah you book smart but don't be gettin' paper
Shootin' craps at The Wynn
Gettin' back to back wins
Made 20 bands playin' features
And I don't need a feature for this
Nigga I'm T-R-A, triple double
Every time I ball, man that's triple double
Tom Ford, Balmain, that's triple stuntin'
Tryna get a nut only gets you nothin'
So I don't give a fuck who these niggas datin'
Tsunami the Rollie, my wrist is flooded
How the fuck can these niggas hate it
When these bitches love it, man this shit is funny
All I can do is laugh, all I can do is laugh
They try to count me out, all day I'm doin' math
All I can do is add, multiply, multiply
All day I'm doin' math, but we won't divide
You ain't got the flow, you ain't got the heart
You be on your mark but you're never ready
You just talkin' shit, I can smell your breath
Sayin' what you do, but can't help yourself

[Chorus]
So why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched the bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the codefendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

[Bridge]
She a big girl, dog
Fuck what they talkin' about, nigga
She a big girl, dog
I'm gonna do what the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do
She a big girl, dog
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated

[Outro]
Might take her home, gon' and dinner plate it
I don't heat it up, don't microwave it
She already hot, she sizzle baby
No salt and pepper, she been the flavor
I'ma stimulate her, yeah simple, baby
Fuck with me, then I fuck with you
You don't fuck with me, my nigga fuck you too
She a big girl, dog
She a big girl, dog
She a big girl, dog
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated




[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did A Milli, 50 did a milli
Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome; applaud him!

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3 thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovate, ayyy

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay-Z]
Every day a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was duckin' one time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey, Pres Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay
They come, they go, some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him
No sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders
Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for 'em!

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + J. Cole]
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em! (I'm here now, Fayettenam)
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! J. Cole
Every day a star is born




[Verse]
Trying to save up for the Flints and the Cool Greys
Done skipped many school days going to buy some new J's
Turn whole days to half days, fuck it I just skip it all
Go to this girl house who DTF whenever I call
Yea, I’m a player no matter the sport
Hitting home-run touchdowns on a open court
Couple traffic violations and misdemeanors, I hate court
So I smoke right before it
Stand in front of the judge red eyes, fresh shape up
He ask me what's my plans, I say "I'm trying to get my cake up"
See I’m a black male you know the odds is against us
Roll with the punches, Mayweather what it is bruh
Catch me in Baltimore walking around high as fuck
In some low chucks, whipping my uncle's pickup
My Lex in the shop, the damn transmission went up
I'm done with that shit I saw this dope whip on Craigslist
Only 4 Gs like that iPhone bullshit
Audi A4 blue paint with a V6
Bitch so sexy when I seen it I got hard dick
Bout to be 18 I need to find a damn apartment
Hope this job at the Apple store go through
They got a couple of employees I'm trying to run through
Here I go thinking with my dick again, the very thing that ruins my relationships
I'm a bag of chips, I think I'm all that
Knees fucked up keep fucking on the carpet
My bed make too much noise
And once she piss me off I pass her off to my boys
I swear I need to change man, listen to my songs you think I don't respect women
It's not like that at all because my mom raised me better
I’m only after sex because they only after cheddar
Just let em blow my trumpet because my blues mo betta
Filling condoms up like a red cup
College party bitch everybody drunk
Catch me getting ladies like that cartoon Skunk
They let me do what I want because they with it from the jump
Girl them kitties faking like I hit a double pump
But I’ll sign em if you want
Roll me up a J, don't really fuck with them blunts
I did my research and in the long run them fucking blunts going to hurt
You bound to catch a heel if you keep chasing skirts
Girls want what they can’t have
Niggas want girls with phat ass
Something nice they can grab
She just want a new bag
I'm dangerous nigga, hazmat
Walk around with a gas mask
Where they do that at?
Girls showing their ass I ain't impressed by that
I need a girl I can love, that ass is a plus
Discuss not fuss, loyalty and trust
Know how to bust a nut, shoot it out in her butt
Damn nigga I'm nasty as fuck
Your girl don’t seem to mind
Nice taste nigga, yea yo she fine
I really like that trick that she do with her behind
But all and all she a good chick
Need to put a ring on it like a tone for your sidekick
I keep a sidekick for my side-chicks
Keep them convos private, them condoms I supplied it
First thing my uncle taught me when he got out of jail
"Never take a condom from a female"
And I live by the lessons that I've learned
So if I say I will it's no need to be concerned
So if I say I will it's no need to be concerned nigga




[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Maria hey, hey, Maria
Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria?
Maria, girl you know you were the only one

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
How was I supposed to know
That it would cost my soul?
Nothin is free', outchea
I wanna breathe outchea
And how am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created?
Is that the price that I'm payin'?
I wanna feel it

[Pre-Chorus 1: Christina Aguilera]
All my life, wouldn't give up
Was too young to know the difference
How did I get so low?
When did I turn so cold
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies
I'm facing the mirror

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just need to see ya, Maria

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
Now do you hear it in my voice?
That I'm tryna make a choice
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads
You duck taped my mouth shut
Make me feel worthless, used up

[Pre-Chorus 2: Christina Aguilera]
So tired of painting all this makeup
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts
Eyes open, but can't see
Mouth open, but can't speak
I'm facing the mirror

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Where, where, where is Maria?
Oh, I just wanna see ya, Maria

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Oh, my lord (oh)
Can you take away this heavy load? (oh)
I can't carry it anymore (oh)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?
Oh, my lord (oh, my lord)
Can you take away this heavy load? (Can you take away this heavy load?)
I can't carry it anymore (I can't)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
You keep on running away

[Verse 3: Christina Aguilera]
Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya
Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya
Don't keep on runnin' away (you keep on runnin' away)
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Where, where, where is Maria?

[Outro: Christina Aguilera]
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Where is Maria?
You know I need ya
Where is Maria?

This performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song

Blood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: "Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees." The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community

West performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It’s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience’s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America

Http://divaartist.com/divablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot_2013-08-26-00-20-13_1.jpg

After the performance West posted a picture of the tree captioned: "those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree."

Https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1377548967_JKYK1ZZ.jpg

This nuanced imagery, rife with symbolism, paints a powerful and disturbing scene that adds potency to West’s message of the relics of slavery in today's society




[Intro: Bryson Tiller & Kanye West]
DJ Hannah
Ohio's best DJ
Killer Instinct
Tiller Instinct
I don’t know man, it’s just... (laughs)
Why are you so paranoid (I can’t help it)
Why are you so paranoid (ay, they didn’t know I could sing girl)
Don't be so...

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
They say to me
Don’t worry 'bout it
I’ll be famous
Keep on dreamin’ about it
I worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
I worry ‘bout the wrong things, the wrong things
I’m tryna do my own thing, my own thing
And put on for my home team, my own team

[Refrain 1]
Ya
Everybody tellin’ me I should never think about it
(I’d rather somebody tell me I can’t be successful)
Sometimes, I just don’t really give a fuck
(Even though I can, ha)
(Where my fans at? That’s what they tell me)
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
(They know, they know)
They never know you
(Famous, one day)
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
(They know, that I'll be...)
They never know you

[Verse: Bryson Tiller]
I’m paranoid, yo
And sometimes I be thinking this ain’t for me
But when I hit 'em with the flow
Everybody up, everybody standin’ at their feet
They never would’ve guessed
Somebody so talented would ever give up, no
I made a whole mixtape just to show a nigga I deserve a deal
Show 'em I could go
If they sleepin’ on me then I’m Freddy, Kroeger
Time to win it all, man
Forget these losers
Haters won’t befriend me
But that goes against my killer instinct

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Anyway, they don’t know you like I do
They never know you
Anyway, they don’t know you like I do
They never know you




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now that you're tuned in
I suggest you zoom in
And claim Puff dead
I'm out the tomb then
I'm married to the game like the bride and the groom is
If you don't want to move then leave the room here
See you the type of nigga believe the rumors
But I'm the type to show y'all what the truth is
And show you how the coupe is
And you don't know where the roof is
And the interior is stupid
So I'mma shoot my shot and just do it
Cause I can't stop my love for the music
Been a decade since Biggie dropped "Juicy"
When I think back sometimes I still lose it
And feel the ambiance
From the screams of the audience
And y'all response

[Chorus: John Legend]
I'ma give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we
Gonna give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we

[Interlude: Termanology]
Cause we can't stop, and you don't stop, cause you can't stop
What's up, rap world
I figured I'd take this opportunity to look outside of myself and say
What would I say if I was them

[Verse 2: Termanology]
9-1 Heavy D, 9-2 Mary J
No more Uptown
Bad Boy on the way
9-3, 9-4 B.I.G.'s in the door
9-5 making hits, Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique
Craig Mack, "Flava in Ya Ear"
Don't stop there, Lil' Kim posing in the panties and a brassiere
Sayin' "Biggie Biggie give me one more chance
"Biggie Biggie give me one more chance" ah man
Fly chicks, rolling in fly whips
9-6 Bad Boy invented the remix
These hits got the whole world loving my clique
They loving the sound
The whole world hitting my hit
9-7 Big passed and he went up to heaven
Only on the second album he already a legend
Man I wish Big could've seen the world in '07
Matter of fact sometimes I wish I just died with him

[Chorus: John Legend]
I'ma give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we
Gonna give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we

[Outro: Termanology]
I miss him
He's still part of me




[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

[Ma$e]
This is a classic, just add this to the rest of them

[Hook 2X: Ma$e] + (Kanye West)
See I know what you all like
That's why it's goin' to be alright
Everything is all night
(See what my face felt, know how Ma$e felt, c'mon her ya John Legend)
Harlem back be alright, Fo' Reel be alright, Ma$e is back be alright

[Kanye]
Ma$e said c'mon, Mike said chamone
Started up early like Raven-Symoné
Keisha Knight-Pull, Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin' handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name
But ya'll can't hold me down like restraint
I took the T off out the word can't
'round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin' our fam to Iran
I'm in the club with a henny ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me, I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just' and 'em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't eva, eva, accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes, I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm... yea... that something to ponder
The money I make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you, you the next
I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal, nigga

[Hook]

[Ma$e]
Arm frozen on, diamonds and all
Maserati, Bugatti that rode in on
Different color Louis open toes and all
I try to tell the chick don't expose it all
Country dudes mouth full of gold and all
Bay area chick, cornrows and all
I do it right, I do my wife
I leave the hoes for y'all
From the boutique, I might close the mall
I drink my Geico and turn it Gecko
I wave the Roley, you wave the Seiko, need I say mo'
More diamond than LisaRaye
I'm no replica, I am the DNA
Breeze cool, leave you like a hurricane
Somebody get killed, the whole borough blame
M.A. dollar, what a thorough name
No matter who comes through, I'm forever the king
I shoulda neva left the game, that's what a cutie said
Still chicks throwin' me up like newly wed
I'm grown and sexy, done with the groupie head
In the milk white Phantom seats, and ruby red
You heard the rumor, listen to the facts
I drop my cars in pairs like pitty pat
When I'm done with this track, it feel like biggie back
The game is country
I came to bring the city back
I came, I came to bring the city back

[Hook]

[Outro: Ma$e]
Fo Reel put your hands up
Good Music put your hands up
Bad Boy put your hans up
Rocafella put your hands up
Chi-town put your hands up
NY put your hands up
Miami put your hands up
Texas put hands up




[Sample]
I'm gonna have a sweet life, sweetest life you've ever seen
And when the day is over, gonna go to sleep and I feel the greed
Momma can you hear me?

[Verse 1 - Juice]
I'm pushin a Cadillac man, it's black man
And I'm a black man, in a Cadillac man, see what I'm saying is?
Ain't no diamonds in the back, diamonds on my neck
D-Diamonds on my neck, D-Diamonds on my neck
I'm so fresh, so clean, edge sharper than a ginsu
Look at the soul of my Air 1's, see what I been through
Been through the struggle and drove through the fire
Kanye on the track, that nigga spittin' through the wire
I spit that pain rap, every chorus need a choir
Like feinds need suppliers, like Daytons to the wires
I'm rollin', rollin'
Turn my music up and keep rollin', rollin'..

[Hook - The Game]
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'

[Verse 2 - Juice]
I got my back on the wall like a hustler
Smokin' like a muffler, waiting for the customers
I got that that weight, that they push up state for
Feinds can't wait for, enemies hate for
Me to make that cake or drive through the state for
P-H-X, A-Z is what I came for
Rock my chain for, hooked up with Game for
Headed to the booth, shotgun in the Range for
I could make change more, and my shit bang more
Bitches screamin' my name when I open them Range doors
When my ribs was touchin', ain't nobody know 'em
So tell them niggas, picture me rollin'

[Hook - The Game]
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'

[Verse 3 - Juice]
Homie I'm just rollin', rollin', thinkin' 'bout the past
They said I would never last, so even if you trashed
Keep rollin', rollin', and I got a stashspot
Niggas is killin' so my stashspot, got a stashspot
Roll up the window, roll up the endo
Blow it out the sunroof, share it with my kinfolk
My niggas in the grave, my niggas behind bars
Man, there's too many of ya'll, but ya'll know who you are
Gangbangers in the hood, and they shootin' like stars
And the gangbangers I know don't wear shoes with the stars
They tie bandanas, and they shootin' out cars
So I had to turn it around, and start shootin' out bars

[Hook - The Game]
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'

[Outro - Juice]
Yeah, it's a Blackwall Street recording
We got the Juice now niggas
Haha, gone




[Consequence]
Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga...

[Common]
Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out, they houndin' dawg
Sayin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic, exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol' Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

[Kanye West]
The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskay had them girls feelin' friskay
You was with mey, she said "Who's the sissay?"
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

[Hook - Kanye West]
(Wack nigga) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack nigga) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack nigga) Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack nigga) Even if you flossin' rocks you still
(Wack nigga) You can't do it dawg, you's a
(Wack nigga) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack nigga) Even your daughter says "My daddy's a - "
(Wack nigga - You wack nigga!)

[Consequence]
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more that you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

[Talib Kweli]
In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business, niggas don't forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it, I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like, "You hold a gat, right?"
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
You got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' Nuwaubian and followin' Malachi
Or anything but rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got boy!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!

[Hook]

[Havoc]
I'm there for you, here with you, it's clear its crystal
I air before you only get stronger the things, you been through
I don't kill you thats what it'll do
Run with a few multiple-scribed, they say we belong in a fuckin' zoo
We done crashed all sorts of clubs forcin' the love
Often above them cowards and them so called thugs
When we come through respect is there, cause we demand it
Know the mobb is in the building, we officially landed
Keep your eyes on the man with the hammers, they can't stand us
Try to raid us the faggots snitchin' and got the cameras
Cock the cannons but shorty just keep dancin' cuz it might
Be a chance that it won't pop off
If it do stay close to the wall, we gettin' it on
You about to witness fellas who gifted in brawl
My homie Lyndon Erik Da Bob pissin' you off
This southern cat finnin' to get it so kiss ya cross

[Hook]
So if you goin' thru it but you won't let it hold you down
(Just throw up your hands) C'mon ma
We gon party to the crack of dawn lets get it on with the girls and me and my mans

[Prodigy]
Theres only few things I die for
Infamous my family, this money, sonny I hit the sky for
We don't take time off, we take rhymes off
Come with somethin better than that, to blow your mind more
Gettin our shine on... I think this due for a storm, hurricane Mobb
Rain on your parade and you can thank god
Or you can thank P, for simply not squeezin'
Really it wasn't called for, and you don't want it
To call for it, don't play my gun, it go off
Inside of your head oops, niggas be dead
Then we drooped in the Coupes real heavy on the gas
Out there like the concord
I show you how to get murdered, and the cops never catch on
I show you how to do songs, then after than show
You how to do them contracts and get yours

[Hook 2x]

[Havoc]
We ain't finished yet c'mon baby bring it back c'mon
You know that thing in the stash box
Ready to pop bast in the spot you stunt, you know we gon lock ass
Inevitable, can't control them slugs
Came from a place, that shape and mold them thugs
Flood the block with nothin but that gangsta shit
Y'all dead on that, now take ya miss, bitch

[Prodigy]
It's plain to see, that you could never snake me
I never let the grass grow past my Nikes
Summertime in our wife beats, boiled this brick
Outside with thermo shirts underneath tees
I stalely keep a mack on me, and let people
Try and contest Mobb Deep

Uh, yeah, yeah, c'mon

[Hook]

Yeah
M-O-B-B Baby
(Just throw up your hands)
0-4.. Kanye
Flip it out my nigga




[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West & The-Dream]
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll love, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream & Kanye West]
Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all?
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything, I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Nas]
When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, "I thought you would protect me from this scary place?"
"Why'd you let them inject me?"
"Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?"
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, "Screw that bus!" – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Nas]
Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Vaccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West and The-Dream]
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll live, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus: Kanye West]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream & Kanye West]
Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Intro: Kanye West]
It's real, all dreams real

[Verse 1: Ant Clemons]
My boy text me, he told me, "Dream big"
Like the cars that we own now, remember we used to lease it
Now we undefeated, look at what the team did

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
All dreams, real
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real
All dreams, real, real

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
Spirit of Coltrane with us
Old slang, you know the old saying
Ho's saying, "He sold out," out the stores, mane
I like soul beats and pj's, I'm so plain
Opps crowded around my house like I was Houssein
Came and grabbed me out my house like I was insane
Doc saying, "There's something wrong with his membrane"
I've been suffering from lack of sleep, bitch I been drained
Gotta high type of tolerance for that type of pain
Pour some, I won't go numb 'till it's okay
Here we go, I'm off the drink and now we in things
We was lowkey, heard you wanted to avenge things
We approached, we ain't gon' make it 'till the endgame
Guess that's just what you got to do to get the rent paid
I ain't gon' hate on no man to get a bill paid
Bills ain't the real pain, the real pain is real pain
Your self ain't your self, doubting fake love
But

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
All dreams, real (Real)
It's that no limitations, babe
All dreams, real (Real)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah 'Ye cold
But that Trump hat forced me to feel like I like J. Cole, damn
My own city turned they back on me
They thought I told Push about Drake's son, goddamn
Like I ain't want them to run, goddamn
I guess they fall and they dumb, goddamn
I don't care about his son, goddamn
I just rap about me, goddamn
Niggas can't resist the bliss of treat for free, goddamn
Always wanting something like it isn't me, goddamn
Everytime, I rap it, this ain't charity, goddamn
Energy that never die, energy that stay alive
Energy, the synastry I'm finna see a sinner see ya
I could see ya, color feel ya
Bona feature, extra features
I'm allegiant, all the deats, all the features
And the teachers and the preachers
They could reach us on the feature
All the leaches, all my bleachers
I was just in the bleachers
Jump the bleachers, I'm a thesis
That's my thesis, Holy Jesus
Um

[Chorus: Kanye West]
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real (Real)

[Outro: Kanye West]
Gotta let 'Ye be 'Ye
Let me? Psh-psh-nigga?




[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right

[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford, to fake anymore
To live this facade and smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn
We'll pretend we're having tonnes of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone
Is she thinking of me, did she forget what we once had?

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, they got it all, you can see they got it all
They got the cars, the boat, and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of it all
He wants his kids and the dog, he wants his breakfast in bed
He's got his trust fund saved, not a worry in his head
But it's not you, homie
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
'Cause I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right
Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

[Bridge: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone
You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Yeah I feel like taking off
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Let me be your supernova
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
And I feel like taking off
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Let me be your supernova
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
(You've got it wrong if you say our love is gone)
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right




[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart, (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart




5. Nas - "Queens Get The Money" Produced by Jay ElectronicaThat's right! Before he signed to Jigga man, Jay Electricity was off producing for none other than Nas. This is minimalistic beat 101 - a cold Jay Electronica beat stripped bare of drums. The piano throughout the whole record is a looped sample from "Summer 78 (Instrumental)" by Yann Tiersen

The track also features a lion roar in the beginning of the song. Nas uses this as a statement that he's going in on the beat and pulling no punches! – 0nelove4. ScHoolboy Q - "Hoover Street" Produced by SounwaveSounwave is an in-house producer for TDE & produced two of the best tracks from Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city. The intro starts at 84BPM, switching to 79BPM when the beat changes from the first verse onwards. During the intro, Sounwave makes use of vocal layering and reverb to echo the "How'd it feel" section. The instrumentation varies; using drums and other percussion, synths, FX (scratches, Lex Luger one-shots) and occasional brass. Thundercat was the bass guitarist on the song!

The track contains 2 samples both after the intro and beat changes;
A subtle vocal sample from "The Chamb" by The Mohawks in the background and the drums from "Ain't No Sunshine" by Harlem Underground Band

Originally this song was called "Familia" and in the last seconds they switched sample, the prior was done by Alchemist so he didn't get any credit. – UnBalanced3. Capital STEEZ - "Dead Prez" Produced by Joey Bada$$The instrumental is dark and jazzy. It sets the tone for Capital STEEZ's rapping with the creation of a mournful mood, which complements the melancholy lyrics on the topic of his goals in rap

The beat was created primarily with a sample from a Galt MacDermot song named "Coffee Cold".The beat's mournful tone is due to the sampled meandering piano melody, heavy bass, gritty drums, as well as the eerie synth whistle

"Coffee Cold" was also sampled by Handsome Boy Modeling School in "The Truth" & Gang Starr in "Werdz From the Ghetto Child" – Jankoz2. Kid Cudi  - "My World" Produced by Jeff Bhasker & Plain Pat"My World" sees Cudi teaming up with old pal Plain Pat. He produced several tracks from MOTM I, MOTM 2 and Scott's original mixtape A Kid Named Cudi. The other contributor Jeff Bhasker a.k.a. Billy Cravens has helped produce several critically acclaimed albums including My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Watch The Throne. They collaborate with Cudi to give us a sombre yet vivid instrumental

Two samples from Le Système Crapoutchik's 1971 song "All What I Have" were used throughout "My World". The first is immediately recognizable as the strings that come in right at the beginning. The second sample occurring at 1:07 forms the basis of the song's hook, "This will be my world". Only Bhasker could pull off something like this! – treflip1. Kanye West - "Dark Fantasy" Produced by Kanye West & Co
The intro to My Beatiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is originally a beat that Ye got from RZA. Kanye and the rest of the producers then built around it, hence it's influence from the "bring-the-ruckus" aesthetic. No I.D spoke to Complex Magazine and commented on which producer did what part:While I was in Hawaii, RZA came down and had a beat—but before that Pete Rock had given us a beat and then he ripped the drums and made it the rap part of it. The parts that me and Ye did was the chorus and the musical parts. Everything was done separately and a lot of different people contributed. Then Nicki did the intro and it went crazyIt's a quick-paced production with a brooding production brought by RZA, West raps in a highly melodic manner - almost singing some of his verses. It contains one sample and one interpolation. "Could we get much higher" is sampled from "In High Places" by Mike Oldfield & Nicki Minaj's intro is an interpolation of Cinderella from Roald Dahl

There's also an interesting story to how Teyana Taylor got on the hook and backing vocals! – 0nelove




[Intro]
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)

[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long
(Jesus walk with me)

[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

[Chorus]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

When it hits you won't know what to do
Relax let me move you
Don't resist it's in the air

Let it flow right through you

I know your getting tired of the same old thing
But I'm gon' break the rules gonna change the game

You couldn't picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear cause you're here with me

[Verse 2]
And once you take a hit of this

Then I'll have you spinning round and round
Crazy making freaky sounds
You won't want to come down

And then I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating
Even walking funny 'cause your legs are shaking
All night we'll be blazin'
I'll take you for a walk to the other side
We can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight and we'll be alright

[Hook]
We'll get lifted
(Lifted)
Ohh I'm gonna get you high

[Freestyle 1: Kanye West] (To Nick Cannon)
Ayo dog
Nicky my dog
And this is for sure
So I'm not going to break you down
Ask Christina Millian know what we did on tour
Stays on tour, and i'll tell you right now
And I like Indian girls, but I won't hurry
Last time we boned, you had the bedroom smelling like curry

[Freestyle 2: Kanye West] (To Kat Williams)
Come on boss
You were suppose to be the Pimp and Prince
I've seen you in Friday after next
And I haven't seen you since

[Freestyle 3: Kanye West]
Look it's hard for me to say shit
Cause I don't know about that gay shit
But I see you do, looking like Tiger Woods
Like lost in the hood
Looking like Bryant Gumbel
And expect me to be humble
Every time I flip a fold your goin to crumble
With them phony ass pony's
Bitch read the news
Why you always try running in the back and grab all the free shoes
So Why don't you buy somethin' ?
Why don't you try somethin' ?
Stop lying, stop fronting
Y'all niggas don't know about nothing

[Freestyle 4: Kanye West]
I could rip all of yall
In a line
With every rhyme
Yall know Kanye, is like the greatest all time
'Cause I do the Grammys, and comeback with my family
Rippin' you muthafuckers
With the mic that you hand me
You all don't understand me dawg
You still pushing camrys
Please, step back for a minute
You the Lieutenant, I'm the General
And generality killing yall
And Yeah, and I could keep it right there
Kanye ripping you niggas
This shit is unfair!




*Lyrics from snippet*

[Chorus: Victory Boyd]
Glory, the old things would pass away
Glory, glory prophets say that spirit in the bright sake
Jesus raise the rain, get down on your knees and pray
Have faith, yeah, believe what the Bible say
Jesus praise, give us grace to fight with power
Be our human strength
Supernatural gifts, you shower on your faithful saints

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We got something better than gold
Blessings raining down on thousandfold
Grace and annointing over gold
Goodness and notions God loathes
Glory dripping all over the place
Tables spraying like a buffet
We ain't worried 'bout what people say
We gon' worship God anyway

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Victory Boyd]
Glory, the old things would pass away

Have faith, yeah, believe what the Bible say
Jesus praise, give us grace to fight with power
Be our human strength
Supernatural gifts, you shower on your faithful saints

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We can feel it burning in our souls
Jesus take the wheel, let's lose control
We just called the Holy Ghost
The doors to the church will never close
Satin givin' how we think we roll
Take it, leave it how we feel we roll
Jesus take the wheel, let's lose control
Devil throwing up the full, I can't fold
Like the doors in the church, I'll never close

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Intro: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]
Let me know if you're feelin' lonely

[Verse 1: The Game]
'Cause ain't no real niggas out here
Ye what these niggas start hummin' out their mouth with?
Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums
Bunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style
When we originated this, whole motherfuckin' album had hits
That's why we up in the Ritz
That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho
Get you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo
Bail long as Alonzo Mourning
Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05
No lie, J's on
Take these motherfuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Rewind, J's on
Take these motherfuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'ma get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around, how that saying go?
Documentary 2, no 50, keep the change hoe

[Hook: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]
Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night

[Verse 2: The Game & Kanye West]
Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
I, I, (aghhhhk)
Spit in the face of a coward
Shit on anybody ever try to take ours
Ye why that nigga's face so sour?
Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower
Now what you know about power?
What you know about dreams?
What you know about freestylin' versus each other
Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans

[Hook: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]
Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night

Harder, better, faster, stronger

[Chorus]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger

That's how long I been on ya
(Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger)

[Verse 1]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Intro: Fats Gonder]
So now ladies and gentlemen this is star time
Are you ready for star time?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya bitch
Let it go

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now

Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him no
Summertime rain with him no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him no
Want it done bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now
Something down in nah-ney with em now
Like we always
Talk to me like we always
The illuminati
Dirt Bike or a Kawasaki
Bottle up on a new party

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now

And if you're out in the crowd

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
With your praying hands
For you lil' niggas I'm way advanced
And I don't write rhymes, I write tattoos
And when I die they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch that's a bad move
Bitch get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money
Sell it for [?] if I want to

[Hook]
God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now
God dammit
Don't you play with you

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Don't play boy
Someone [?] what you made boy
Hoppin in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play boy
Cause I married a playmate

When you stay eight
And they rate
[?]
I kinda want the nudes
Something for when I'm in that mood
Woo




[Intro: Sample (JAY-Z)]
I'm not a one girl's guy... (real talk for ya, peep game)
Ain't they know it, when it comes to love, I don't lie
(we don't lie man)
And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open (I may never say never)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from (too many ladies, ha)

[Pre-Chorus: JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Woo! Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin'?
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin'?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in house tutorin'
In and out I'm movin' through her student body union
And she, call me "Professor," say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school

[Chorus: JAY-Z (Sample)]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
(I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girrrrrls out)
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Huh, who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Who said what, why you trippin' girl, why's you fussin'?
Got this model slash actress slash part time waitress
Spend her whole day, she hanging round with part time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put a up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries in ten places at once
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
And some day I slow down, but for now I get around
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty inches
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business

[Chorus: JAY-Z (Sample)]
(I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girrrrrls out)
Put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louis, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

[Chorus: JAY-Z (Sample)]
(I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girrrrrls out)
Put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Outro: The Persuaders sample]
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my nose? can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin' girls out, waitin' patiently
Just tryin' girls out, until I find the one for me

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

[Outro: Rick Ross, Pusha T & Together]
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on




[Kanye West]

Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

[Kanye West]

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...




[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah (ooh, la-la)
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah
Do you like foreplay? Ooh, yeah
Do you go both ways? I really need confirmation
Your love is abomination, fucking you is like a bomb of nations
Area 51 in that pussy, ah
The president 'bout to cum in that pussy, ah
I got mind control, I got dick control
I reel 'em in for the fishing pole
I love legs like Robyn Fenty
Stretch them shits like limo Bentleys
Catch them tits with an open mouth
The interview up outta that Oprah house
You know I love it when it's pokin' out
You know I'm thuggin' even in the drought, you know him
I fuck around and crash a brand new Bugatti
In the mothafuckin' lobby so you know I'm in it better
Won't you kiss it, baby? Take a picture
I, I, I, I, I'm killin' em
Illuminati want my money and my body
Even Donny rollin' by me, looking aggravated that I made it
Fuck you and your mama, nigga
I, I, I, I, I see the bitch in them, I got the Benjamin
I got the dividend, I'm on my toes like Serena at the Wimbledon
Pie à la mode on a Monday for my woman-friend
I'm in the mode of a mortal man
I'm living in the orbit of deliverin'
Sex in a cathedral, empty, Grand Marnier that I reload, ten Gs
In the hallway, she a Leo, I'm a Gemini
Give me mine, genocide, kill 'em all, thirty times

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Who can I make that them better right now?
Who, oh I know that'll make it better right now?
Who do I know that'll make 'em better right now?
Who do you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated I, I, I
If I ever instigated I, I
Tell me who will never related, I

[Outro: Kanye West]
Why I fucked you this evening
At Southside, live for these things
By the way, how you feelin', forgot
I don't give a fuck about your family and that, oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, back it up, oh oh
Back it up, yeah




Now I'm the newest member of the rockafella team
And I'ma bring Dame and HOV mad more cream
Hooks galore
Leave your city shook for sure
And I'ma bring 'em back where Beans took 'em before
For the last time it's 'Kanye' and not Kane
Everybody mispronouncing the name
So I spell it over and overlike my dog Fab in the game
Pick a bad chick up like a cab in the rain
All the girls that I had was the same
Cuz all they seemed to care about is what I had in the chain
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Drop the bad bitch off take a cab in the rain

Go! Why she wanna say 'hello,'
Cuz my Rock-a-fello piece is all yellow?
Yeah! She tryna get nice
Get a crib, get a ring, throw rice
No, keep that raggedy chick
She's so masculine and I ain't on that faggoty shit
My diamond ornaments help me fornicate
Girls that look like they on a porno tape
My dogs is warning me 'bout girls is wanting me
For child support, this money born to make
They stick safety pins in my magnums
Steal my condoms, I swear that's a problem

It's like gettin' robbed without a pistol
For 18 years the job is not an issue
Cuz I made a mil off instrumentals
Classify me as husband potential
Niggas ain't think I rhyme for real
I got a 'You Hear It First' 'fore I signed a deal
Yeah, now it's time to bail
Cuz five years from now I'm tryna chill
Peep the wordplay, I'm kinda ill
I don't rap about guns dog I'm kinda real (I only rap about what I do and that 50 Cent's hot)

That's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
OC, OG Bobby Johnson's son
Ask me "Ray Ray is that your car?
I seen MTV I know who you are
You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?"
I DID take-over the game, brought back the Soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum and gold, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gotsta blow
And I don't play 'pause', I'm from Chica-GO




[Intro (Over Chorus): Kanye West & Audience]
Now if the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air, keep your diamonds in the air
Your diamonds in the air, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk–
Through the fire, through whatever, come what–
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all–
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizz-ork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Interlude (Over Chorus): Kanye West]
Yeah, through the limits, to the wall
If y'all know this, sing along with it
What? I hear you, I hear you, I hear you
Through the– uh, through whatever, come
I can't hit that note either, fam
Yeah
Uh, uh, question

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It's more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If y'all could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
There's a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
Y'all thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
I look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so we turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the–
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it–
Through the fire, through whatever, come what–
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro (Over Chorus): Kanye West & Audience]
Yeah, say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Now throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Keep your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Now keep your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Keep your diamonds in the air, keep your diamonds in the air
Your diamonds in the air, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah




[Hook: Tru James]
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

[Hook: Tru James]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work baby?"
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends."
On the phone, hollin' that "niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress."
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far."
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herds, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot

[Hook: Tru James]




[Intro: Kanye West & Young Thug]
High lights

If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich

[Interlude: Carole King & Kanye West]
You've got to get up every morning
You've got to get up every morning

And show the world that you've got love in your heart
Oh no, gotta play this shit back

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
And eventually there's gon' be so many niggas
[?] pool party on the weekend, that's the business
There's one white girl told me she hate white cock
That's when I knew hip hop was the new rock
When you know you gotta keep your business zip-loc'd
Cause the nigga still got her Gucci flip-flops
[?] take her on a c-cold adventure
Old bitches know I put the dick on they dentures
Might tell 'em Lexington Steele is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious, huh?
What she need is an hour of some inches, huh?
Got a thick dick hopping on some trenches, huh?
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches. huh?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian, huh?
She spent a whole check on some Christians, huh?
And that bitch ain't even religious, huh?
I'm respected, I'm way too prestigious
Y'all motherfuckers throwing bows like Riddick
Crack coke, crack sale, white niggas got mail
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastel
Walkin', livin', breathin', god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
Hah, huh, what you want?
Want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

[Sample: Jen Selter]
(I love social media, I love fitness and I love photography)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I need at least seven days with Chloe Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny, it ain't never been the same
I ain't gon' tell ya that I've never been a lame, but
Ever since with Hov, I got that Roc-A-Fella chain
Man, shit just changed, shit just changed
My nigga Dame said let's get this change
Get this thing, iPhone thing
[?] then I hit

[Hook: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
We only makin' the highlights (slow motion, slow motion)
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be only be highlights

[Post-Hook: TWF Tony Williams]

Tell ‘em!

[Kanye West]
… Aight!
I want y’all niggas to know…
That I’m the newest member of the Roc-a-fella team!




[Intro]
God is
My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
God is

[Verse]
Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

[Outro]
That's what God is
That's what God is
That's what God is




[Intro:]
This one for my baller niggas
That hate when the weakest ho in the club try to approach him
Some songs the ladies love me
The girls gon' hate me for this one
But I gotta do it
Come on

[Hook 1:]
Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?

[Verse 1:]
She asked
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
No, that's a niche
Rock Clavin Klein
So she can see K
I'm still doing 120 on the freeway
She still got a prom picture in her key-chain
I told her look
This ain't high school no more
I'm tryin'a fuck being cool no more
So niggas go ball
Just to perform
Cause all these rats be talking up a storm
I know what they worn
I know what they be liking
If they hair short
Said "They probably be dyking'"
Probably a drying
Probably you like it
I can't know what
You're probably a psychic
I know a crazy bitch by the look in her eyes
I know a cheating bitch gonna look at my guys
I know a fat bitch gonna look at them fries
Tell me on the side like
"Can I supersize?"
Got my meat in my ride
Go down while I drive
Some hoes ain't for show
You just keep 'em inside
Call 'em at 3 AM and get deep up inside
Blow me and my homie, when you see me you don't know me
You heard?

[Hook 2:]
Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?
This ain't a song I made for ugly hoes to start approaching me

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2:]
Woah
She
Rock the jeans above the knees
Oh them must be some kid capris
So I spend cheese
Urp!
Bitch please
Your girlfriend ain't tell you 'bout me
Kanye fuck 'em and leave 'em
Act like he don't need 'em
See titties and squeeze 'em
For no fucking reason
"Ugh, he's so classless grabbing asses
How would you do a nerd bitch with glasses"?
Pimp nigga never spent no dough on a booty
I wish I would take this fat hoe to the movies
Them niggas must not know the price of the Coogi
I'ma little too rich to fuck this broke bitch
The survey says: "By the streets according
Kanye more important than Michael Jordan
Got this rap game locked, you could call the warden
Give hoes cock then I'm gone by morning

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Damn I was wrong..how could I stoop so low?
Pull up in a four door volvo
Dropped the top and swooped yo hoe
Woah..oh no
I don't want no wild body bitch in my wild body 6
No fucking weak hoes in my fucking Regal
No bitch that's whack in my Cadillac
No bitch with a fade in my Escalade
No sluts with a gut in my Beamer truck
No ? in my gold Jaguar
Deep voice bitches like "{vocalizes deep murmurings}"
"I never thought Kanye would take it this far!"

[Outro]
Remember back in high school?
Like prom queen, right?
She was like 37-25-36
Now she 37 with 25 kids
Ya' know what I'm sayin?
Now she on the come up
Tryna get a baller nigga
Bitch heard my song on the radio
She heard me on the Jagged Edge shit
Memorized my cell phone number out the blue
Called me on some..
"I wasn't sure if that was you or not"
Bitch you ain't hear me say Kanye Titter at the beginning?
Gold digging bitch




[Intro]
You know you got me fucked up
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna touch nobody else

[Intro: Pharoahe Monch]
Violinist extraordinaire
Uh, Miri Ben Ari
Kanye on the beat
And Pharoahe Monch in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Let's go

[Chorus]
We can't stop let's go, oh
We are the future, you are the past
Don't get in our way, 'cause we'll kick your ass
You might be on top now, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
The master speaks, masterfully, what he has mastered
For floors to change, new laws are forecasted
It's bigger than the dirty south, but bi-coastal
It's global, war and the weapons we choose are Pro Tools
Rap moguls get slapped with vocals
Until they learn this colloquialism, we going postal
It's what I am supposed to do, is oppose you
Revolution to stop the thinking that's old school (whoo)
Let me assist you like Malone from Stockton
I'm in the cockpit, cocked back and locked in
Indoctrinated with these [?] toxins
Refuse to be labeled, degraded and boxed in
Let's go

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we are the future, oh oh, you are the past
Oh oh, don't get in our way, oh oh, 'cause we'll kick your ass
Oh oh, you might be on top now, oh oh, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
We put the gospel on wax, sit back through time
Some five years from now is when I'll conceive the rhyme
The future, fuck, you might want to rewind it back
20-0-9, free speech is a crime
You destroy the very planet you inherit from the past
Tomorrow does not accept credit cards and cash
Quick, you need to push Bush stinking ass outta office
Then observe a 40 day fast, for real
So that the darkness will end
Miri sang with strings, Kanye did it again
Pharoahe provides the light but y'all still question the future
The omen to what's destined, oh

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we are the future, oh oh, you are the past
Oh oh, don't get in our way, oh oh, 'cause we'll kick your ass
Oh oh, you might be on top now, oh oh, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Violin solo: Miri Ben-Ari]

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we are the future, oh oh, you are the past
Oh oh, don't get in our way, oh oh, 'cause we'll kick your ass
Oh oh, you might be on top now, oh oh, but time moves fast
Oh oh oh oh oh, we can't stop, let's go

[Violin outro: Miri Ben-Ari]




[Verse 1]
The problem is it ain't that I'm very good
It's that I'm scary good
Beats very hood, doin' numbers Mariah Carey would
Or in Hollywood doin' movies Jim Carrey would
Pardon, he's narcissist, we spittin' shit so arsonist
When I know the globe already warm before I spit
Woah, woah, woah, yeah, homie, that's the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always pray to have (?) on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do I mean I drink (?)
And I was high as the Learjet, fly as the insect
Even though we in debt
And it don't matter what the night, I get her number
Cause when I get my number right, she gon' come runnin'
And I be good like God with an extra O
God knows that my cheque needs some extra Os
And you know that you need to need to bring some extra hoes
Nothin' (?) penis, either tell 'em bring some sexy clothes

[Intro: Diabolic and Poison Pen with DJ Static Scratches]
Poison Pen: Triple Optix.  Yeah.  Y’all fear this dude.  Stronghold.  Stronghold
Diabolic:  Haha.  Motherfucking Diabolic. Stronghold Mixtape Volume 2.  It’s a wrap for the game.  It’s over with.  I told you, bitch.  Come on.  Poison Pen, what up?  Breez Evahflowin’, what up?  C-Rayz Walz, what up?  L.I.F.E. Long, what up?  Mike the Terror.  Come on.  Stelf Index

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
You want to blam-blam, keep your hand balanced and pull it
Take your best shot or use your most talented bullet
Black talons and full clips.  I could clap too
You couldn’t catch a body if I threw somebody at you
I’m Strongholding, slap you ‘til my palm’s swollen
Then cut your baby mom open like Ron Goldman
Traum rolled in green-tubed Garcia Vegas
I’m sharp as razors raised with a heartless nature
I don’t care about airing out your parents’ house
‘Til blood splatters on your mom’s Donna Karan blouse
It seems apparent now.  If I’m staring at you
You’d better fall back like someone’s there to catch you
Trust me, ‘Bolic decide what the truth is
The truth is I’m the truth.  Y’all lie in your music
I’ll find it amusing.  That’s to say the least
I say, “It’s beef.”  You hide out and pray for peace
I’ll move next with two TECs, accusing ya
Executioner here to two-step with Lucifer
Stepped into Hell.  Then Heaven just fell
I got questions but I’ll never question myself
See, I’m tipsy, too busy checking my cell
Or in the drunk tank, cops checking my cell
Diabolic.  Always foul when I speak
Shit on you and wipe my ass with this Kanye beat
I’m wild in the street, can’t keep my composure
I don’t see people.  I see people as cobras
Sic the pitbulls, unload clips and hit you
Or pistol-whip you like Shady’s chick just kissed you
My crew will attack.  We staying true to the facts
Stronghold Mixtape Volume 2.  It’s a wrap




Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.




A man who fought for freedom
A man who fought for equality
Those who were against him
Were too blind to see
What this man was fighting for
So Blacks, Hispanics, Jews and Asians could put their foot in the door
Yes, we know that this man is great
That's why today we celebrate
Everyone lifts their voice and sing
For a man who wanted freedom to ring
Martin Luther King is who I'm speaking of
A man whose name means love




[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
E...

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I'm talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill

[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill




[Intro: Arthur Russell]
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

[Chorus: Kanye West]
But I still drove 30 hours
And I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well, I guess a blowjob's better than no job

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I drove back 30 hours

[Bridge: Arthur Russell]
Where the main ties onto the sail
Better on sighting
For astern, oh

[Outro: Kanye West & André 3000]
3 Stacks, can you help me out?

McDonalds Man
McDonalds Man
The french fries had a plan
The french fries had a plan
The salad bar and the ketchup made a band
Cus the french fries had a plan
The french fries had a plan

McDonalds Man
McDonalds
I know them french fries have a plan
I know them french fries have a plan
The cheeseburger and the shakes formed a band
To overthrow the french fries plan
I always knew them french fries was evil man
Smelling all good and shit
I don't trust no food that smells that good man
I don't trust it
I just can't

McDonalds Man
McDonalds Man
McDonalds, damn
Them french fries look good though
I knew the Diet Coke was jealous of the fries
I knew the McNuggets was jealous of the fries
Even the McRib was jealous of the fries
I could see it through his artificial meat eyes
And he only be there some of the time
Everybody was jealous of them french fries
Except for that one special guy
That smooth apple pie




Yeah, there we go
Pass that man, pass that! Yo!
Yeah kid, take two then pass, man
Yo Grav, you hittin this yo?
Nah, I ain't fuckin with [?]
What's up man? What's up?
Man, yo yo let me tell you:
The reason why he ain't sparkin is because he had a bad trip
Aw yeah, remember that time?
Yo tell 'em about that time we was in your crib sparkin trees kid

Well it was Sunday eve, without a damn thing to do
Sittin thinkin about all of the shit I've been through
Now I'm chillin up at the crib mad shit on my mind
Just got off of work I'm too stressed to write rhymes (bzz)
Surprise visit who is it my bell's buzzin look out the window it's Lumber and Booney "What up cousin?"
(What up Grav? Is you chillin?)
My mind's spillin, matter-of-fact, come up before a brother start illin
Dropped down the keys out the window at a fair pace
They enter the building and start up the staircase
Mad love was given, yo then pounds were exchanged
Yo then Lumber steps back "Ay yo Grav, you look strange..."
I been thinking to hard, black, my brain's all swelled
Yo then Booney's like "Yo, you need to hit up on this here"
Now I know that shit is wrong but it sound right tonight
Pack it tight, spark it on my stove, aight?
Aw, shit! Three seconds it'll make you ill strong
Thus begins the warning of the whole damn song
Yo I should have quit, but a second hit a nigga takes
Yo that was my biggest mistake

One puff was enough, should have quit while I was ahead
Niggas need to chill 'fore they end up dead
One puff was enough, should have quit while I was ahead
Niggas need to chill 'fore they end up dead
One puff
One puff was enough (one)
One puff (one, was enough)
One puff was enough

(Ah) In the beginning it felt like I was winnin this contest of my mind versus the flesh
Can't front, feelin nice so soon was a surprise with the blunt smoke risin to my eyes
Got me actin silly and shit
Takin my mind for trips, got me bustin back flips and splits
My hearin's gettin precise: every sound is heard
Yo Boon, pass the herb so that I can take a third
Hit from the blessin, nigga should have really learned his lesson from the second because now I'm back to stressin
Weed got me actin like a puppet on strings
Fuckin with my mind (got me seein things)
Hey yo it's seemin that the smoke got me dreamin
The pictures on my walls are now images of daemons
My brain's poundin over and over again
Since when was weed a hallucinogen?

One puff was enough
(Y'all fuckers think I'm bullshittin)
(Man, yo, it was wild!)
One puff was enough
(That ain't this though, fucked up!)

I'm tryin to recooperate, gather up my scruples
But unfortunately that philly hit me in quadruple the dosage of a normal blunt
Now my heart's beatin at a faster pace, the blunt must have been laced
Tried to get it out my system through urination
But yo there's only more fucked up hallucinations
Hammer lied when he said it was all good
Cause the colour of my urine is the same colour of blood
Now is it me, or is this shit reality
It seems that the whole world is tryna battle me
I'm starin in the mirror, my condition's getting worse
Panicking just because my reflection's in reverse
Lyin on the bed, tryna rest my head
What's left to say?  I'm fucked up, 'nough said!
Thank God I didn't die
From fuckin with the boo-boo-la

One puff was enough, should have quit while I was ahead
Niggas need to chill 'fore they end up dead
One puff was enough (one puff was enough, dawg)

One puff was enough, should have quit while I was ahead
Niggas need to chill 'fore they end up dead
One puff was enough (Haha, no doubt)

(Man, this nigga was high!)
(You know, it ain't for everybody!)
(Don't give this nigga a puff!)
(Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, let me hit that shit, let me hit that shit!)
(Ahhh!)




[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah

[Chorus: Both, Travis Scott]
1500, all in singles (Straight up)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round we go (Straight up, straight)
Round and round we go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round we go
Round and round we go

[Verse: Teyana Taylor]
He said pray for 'em
Get these bitches out the way for 'em
First lady go cray for 'em
So I loaded up the AK for 'em
Hit it down with my head down
Green Jeep with the loud sounds
Deep bass with the mean brow
Do they get what I see now?
Pray for me, put your one hand in the air for me
Anna Wintour need a chair to see how they stare with the bangs and hair for me
It's like they ain't care for me, soul's life is a spare for me
It's like who ain't for care for me, man who's life is to spare for me
I've been getting money where the hell you been now?
Now I'm about as, somehow I was getting paid out
Leave me out here, if it's no tree then it's no shade out
1500 golden trophies on this bitch a champion

[Chorus: Both, Travis Scott & Teyana Taylor]
1500, all in singles (Straight up, own the city)
Throw it up (Throw it up), watch it fall and drop
Round and round we go (Straight up, straight up)
Round and round we go (Oh)
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round we go
Round and round we go (Go)

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Own the city
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round we go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round we go
Go




[Dave Chappelle]
Tonight's musical guest
Two of Chicago's Finest emcees!
Give it up for Common and Kanye West!

"It's Common Sense!"

[Intro - Common]
Yeah! "Common Sense!" - {*scratched*}
It's Common Sense! With Kanye West!
On the Dave Chappelle Show!
Everybody gotta eat right?
It's the food baby!

[Chorus - Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it "Jump Off" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

[Chorus]

[Verse - Common]
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Kanye West]
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me

[*applause*]




[Choir Enters while humming]

[Verse: 1]
Sun don't shine in the shade
Birds don't fly in a cage (Hey)
Even when somebody pass away
They don't ever really go away

[Pre-Hook]
That's just the waves

[Hook]
Waves don't die
Ay Ay Ay
Waves don't die
Ay Ay Ay

[Chorus: Choir and Chance the Rapper]
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
(hey ay ay)
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah

[Verse: 2]
Wanna see the bricks' right
Tired of getting swished like
They want me on the bench like

[Song tails off...]




[Intro: Royce da 5'9"]
Slaughterhouse movement
Y'all niggas ain't with us then what the fuck is y'all doin'?
Bitches!

[Interlude: Crooked I]
Yeah, Brooklyn go hard
So does Long Beach
Ugh
"Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard"
Crooked he go hard, he go hard (ya love hip hop)
Crooked he go hard, he go hard
We still love this shit
What's up my niggas?
I gotta re-educate my young niggas
It's ya boy! 20 and under
We bout to flip this shit over again
Listen

[Verse One: Crooked I]
I grind hard, treat a cop like an irrelevant wuss
So many pounds in the trunk call it elephant kush
You evidence givin', Sammy Gravanos
Couldn't step in my Ferragamos
Even if you threw 'em at president Bush
I'm back go start my controversy then pass to Rick Warren
Whup ass, you bastards spit borin', you have to get quaran-
'Tined, from the wack disease
I lean back with ease, S-Class with six warrants
Strapped with deez guns costin' an arm and a leg like amputees
I go hard, and I ain't tryin' to say nothin' to rappers gettin' money
But I got a message for west coast DJs
With C.O.B. in the club, I better hear some fuckin' "G-Thang"
And I don't wanna hear no AutoTune if it ain't T-Pain
Wait, I like that 'Ye shit, I must admit
You other niggas... Nah, fuck that shit!
The miseducation of this generation for revenue
They missed innovation, this information they never knew
Why I gotta dumb down? Take a look at my house, nigga
I'm in my master bedroom like a house nigga
Your crib on the hill ain't fuckin' with ours
I'm so close to the Little Dipper
The stripper I'm fuckin'? Her nipples is touchin' the stars
Nah, I ain't flossin' in a recession
I'm talkin' to rappers fuckin' off our profession
If I can't spit bars and still live large
And still whip cars, I'm killin' who's in charge
Even when I drop simple shit
The most intricate jewels are in every line
I just hide 'em behind the instruments, instrumentals
Maybe I'm sentimental, bumpin' Nas when I'm in the rental
I'll kill a pig, come visit me cause I'm in a kennel
Gangsta rap, I'm gangsta plus I rap, strictly coincidental
I grew up around Crips with prison tats
Dealers who made a killin' in the hood but they ain't givin' back
But they come to my show, I gotta give 'em that
They will kidnap niggas dissin' my fitted cap
Long Beach, niggas doin' drive-bys in hybrids
You like a dick in a dyke's privates
You never go in, I go all out
Pull a sawed off out, make you go the alternative route
I mean fall out, boy, y'all know who I am
I'm ill as yellow sneakers fam, shit god damn

[Verse Two: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm a from a grimy city, from a bunch of miles away (C'mon!)
With no regards for the laws, I'm from a sovereign state (Ha-ha!)
From a murderous block (Nah), swervin' in a convertible drop
Makin' sure you heard my proverbial plots (Woo!)
I'm tryin' to take over the world like Pinky The Brain
My dream mistress is a bitch like Pinky with brains (That's right)
Or Roxy Reynolds, I'd stick dick into her
She suck cock for livin', tongue kiss with Murs (Oh!)
But I don't feel anger (Ah!)
So like the frame of the nickel-plated chrome .45
I'ma still bang her (Yes!)
Original renegade, niggas still afraid (Ha-ha!)
More niggas follow than Ashton Kutcher's Twitter page (Woo!)
Chowder time, y'all write, I sprinkle powder lines
If Kelly beat his case, my lawyer gon' swallow mines (Yes)
So put your nines on the crap table
You life gamblin', I'm Patrón sippin', signed to Black Label (Oh!)
Champagne wishes become realities (Yes!)
Bad bitches fly, minus the travel needs (Yes!)
My dick is the biggest thing on my anatomy
I diss niggas for nothin' like, "Why you mad at me?"
("Why you mad at me?")
Haha! Nickel is definitely still reckless (Yes!)
The last nigga done got killed
That made me feel threatened (True story! Hahaha)
Who really cares what a rapper talkin'?
The only feelin' that ain't familiar is after losses
I shoot Edo G in the head and go back to Boston (Brrrat!)
With a trunk full of white, we call it Asher Rothin'
Feel honored if I talk about your ass often
You should wanna sleep in the bed I was jackin' off in (Ho!)
There's a reason these motherfuckers are backin' off him (Why?)
He Floyd Mayweather, Paul Williams and Chad Dawson (Haha)
All rolled up in one; his money trash talkin'
Amongst bosses, chillin' out in the cash office (Woo!)
Nigga, you testin' the one, Nickel second to none (Nice)
I'm hotter than Texas at three, I'm affecting the sun (Pah!)
I don't just sound raw, I'll disconnect your shit
Have you walkin' around with Bobby Brown jaw (Oh!)
And then Whitney said crack was wack
And it offended me like, "Floozy, why you dissin' my music?"
And you can ask Proof, we come from Chopper City
Minus the wack suit and the beef with Ness (Ha!)
Forever inhalin' the smell of that sweet success (Yes!)
That Khaled coke talkin', sayin' "We the best!"
I'm a fan-teaser
This bitch said, "Who the fuck died and made you God?"
I said, "Jesus" (C'mon!) Haha
I'm in the zone, I feel like a star
And nigga you know what to do if you feel like a frog
Go and jump in that traffic, you playin' Frogger
I ain't no blogger, I'm Mr. Rearrange Your Aura (Yes!)
Niggas thinkin' all I got is internet soldiers
'09 is the Fear Year, respect's over
The O.G.s taught me how to do it one way (One)
So I ain't down for no games unless it's gunplay (Uh-uh)
Niggas will murder judges (Judges)
Over murder grudges (Grudges)
I don't put money on heads, I just refer to cousins (Uh-huh)
I drop dope records that's hot like a furnace
The needle on that record player is hypodermic (Yes)
They feed food from an intravenous tube (Tube)
Kill your ass in private, between me and you (Haha)
I'm sick enough to go up in your house
Sick of them rhymes, I spit 'em and throw up in my mouth (Oh!)
You fuckin' around with the Slaughterhouse conglomer-ahd (Yes)
Like catchin' your parents fuckin', I'll leave you traumatized
The beef lives till the drama dies (Dies)
My daughter can get struck by lightning
If I ain't down for homicide (Oh!)
You don't believe in me, you a atheist thug (C'mon, nigga!)
My bitch pussy delicious, it's the Flavor of Love
Fuck what they say, I tattoo your face
Danger, but it ain't For the Love of Ray J (Ha-ha!)
I got a Carhartt, I call my penis "Dickie"
Before I let you bullshit me, I let Serena kick me (It's true!)
And she got thunder thighs, I can just be so heartless
And give you the business, but I ain't from the Chi
A product of the boards where Berry Gordy records
I'm talkin' A-1 yola; this totally pure (Yes!)
I flow bodies of waters, dead fishermen haunt me
I got the temper of a trigger, the dick of a donkey (Oh!)
I'm a soldier boy (Yes!), yeah, I'm the last breathin'
No need to turn on my swag, c'mon, I'm swag sleepin' (Yes!)
Y'all flows are old, y'all sound like last weekend
I'm Marty, Delorean partying with a bad 'Rican

[Interlude: Royce da 5'9"]
Slaughterhouse in this bitch, nigga
Sucker-free, fuck a bitch nigga

[Verse Three: Joell Ortiz]
Brooklyn! Let me get a shot at that, holla back (Geah!)
Down the block from Marcy and Cooper, this guy can rap
Ortiz, I'm an animal (Oh!), flow shit sick
Had midgets in the hospital a few blocks from you (Haha!)
Wood Hall, I stood tall in every battle
Hip-hop's like football, I'm hard to tackle
I'm from where they clap a mac at you then have a Snapple
The Rotten part of the Apple, abandoned tabernacles (Woo!)
Ten-speeds, being peddled by chain snatchers
Good weed, we drug-pedal and aim ratchets
If you from my berg you know we insane bastards so
On the hottest day we sport rain jackets (Ahh!)
Get your brain splattered for a cocaine package
For a little chump change, they push your Rogaine backwards (Grrrr-t!)
I don't know where you from, but where I'm from it's no good
Better take the backstreets to check a chick in my hood (Oh!)









[Intro: Jay Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Chorus]
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 1]
This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone

Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song, wrong
This ain't politically correct (uhh!)

This should make niggas wan' go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken

This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and

You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light (too far nigga) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)

Y'all niggas singing too much

I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here (uhh!)
I don’t be in the project hallway

Nigga just get violent

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
Okay
Ayy!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ayo, poppin' willy shit, let's see who really rich
Y'all ride the beat, I'm about to pop a wheelie, bitch
Really this, I came up with on some silly shit
Look how good it is! I'll show you who you dealin with
Y'all illy? I'm iller, I'm from Illinois
Yo, Big Sean, why don't you call your Chi-Town boys?
Show me where they at, I will destroy
I'm 'bout to fuck somethin up, I might as well call the lawyer
G.O.O.D. Music run this bitch? Yes, we do
I know you thinking, "Damn, I wish 'Ye would bless me too"
In the booth, I use the restroom; It's best you...
Gon' head and kiss the Jesus piece 'cause I just blessed you, unh!
And holy water, odds against Ye, it's slaughter
Ever since I opened up that Midnight Marauders
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment
From the late, great, Mr. Christopher Wallace
They call us pompous; can I be honest?
Honestly, modesty wasn't ever in my policy
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Shoulda said it
As soon as I did it, all that bullshit was deaded

[Hook: Big Sean & Kanye West]
(Get it?) Yup, yup, I get it
G.O.O.D. Music, bitch, ain't nobody fuckin with it
And nah, nah, they can't really do it how we did it
It's G.O.O.D. Music bitch, ain't nobody fuckin with it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
B.I.G. is, "Gee, whiz!" He is...
Sure he would be the man, ever since a fetus
I know it's niggas prayin on my downfall and weak shit
But I'm never going downhill, even on ski trips
I am the D, come and make an observation
It seem like the murder rate is higher than the population
Damn! I bet you just as sweet as you look, bitch
You are just Bushwick, I'm 8-foot-6
I'm so up-up on it like insomniacs
G.O.O.D. Music, man, 'Ye, where he find me at?
I'm so dominant, I'm so confident
That I'ma get a compliment on any fucking continent
From freaks that's fine as shit, without this designer shit
Big business, respect my conglomerate
Girls get check, but my bank get check more
Whenever niggas check up, I'm who they check for
Or have a check for; Louie V shit
So much Damier print, fuck around and play check-ors
And these rappers get critical damages
But I rap so good, it's no need for bandages
You the man in your city? Cool
When am I performing? Right after you
I'm sorry but you gone be ranked right after two
'Cause, I'm first place and second is my crew
So move, bitch! Yeah




[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Man, I know what type of guy you is
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Money, that's my girl! Lookin', you dig?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You know what man, I'm used to y'all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fuck you! Shit you heard that?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I hated on y'all niggas before
But not on no ho shit, I just wanted your hoes
And I ain't gon' lie, I'll lie to a bitch
Quick as hell, you sick as hell, that bitch thick as hell
I let her get my pager, she let me get the cell
Picked her up, did her well, dropped her off, get my mail
Y'all know, she wanna page me all day
Wanna ride the dick like yippee Kanye
I figured though, long as she don't let a nigga know
Game tight, like ankles on Girbauds
And you know go getters be on these hoes
Genuwine, they wanna ride my pony though
Cause their niggas all lame, need to give back their name
Or return their jersey and retire from the game
Why this nigga wanna hate me mane?
Make me take it off safety mane, and make me aim
.380s make it hotter, 87 street
Eight deep in a Cadillac Escalada
That I just leased out with my pants creased out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like peace out

[Hook: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta take it off safety mane
No, no, no, no, no
No I can't let 'em take me mane

[Verse 2: Timmy G]
They don't wanna see a nigga got it made, rappin' on stage
They'd rather see me packin' a gauge, and actin' my age
They say to get your eyes swole, let 'em know how I roll
Never seen six niggas jump out one Oldsmobile
Nah eight, bumpin' Ice Cube
I push rhymes like weight, with nothin' to lose
Still runnin' from the feds in my And 1 shoes
I went from hoppin' fences to jumpin' out of Benzes
Whippin' 4 doors with the mo mos
The gate go up and down like yo-yos
Don't try to play me out 'fore these shots spray you out
Could really give y'all niggas somethin' to hate about

[Hook: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta take it off safety mane
No, no, no, no, no
No I can't let 'em take me mane

[Verse 3: GLC]
It's that go-getter life, bogus life, all I know
Stood on the block for 20 minutes, nigga got off all my blow
Silver rockin' niggas try to hate my gold
Bouncer ass niggas wanna hate my swole
Fiends run around, tryna hate my blow
I found a hater broke in my crib and I'ma break his nose
This ho nigga tried to get me, but he didn't so he slippin'
When I see him, that's when I get him
Now his people say he missin'
I tied him up inside of my truck
Would've been dead if I didn't duck
Could've been shot, I could've been bust
But I dropped, didn't get touched
Just my luck that I had this pump
Nigga didn't know that I had this pump
Came at the nigga like "Uh huh"
What, nigga? Up them funds
Smokers just wanna have fun, bustin' a gun
Kept my Ones laced up when them people chased us
Plus my work in the toilet down in the basement
And I stay a step ahead of all of you haters

[Hook: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why these niggas wanna hate me mane?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta take it off safety mane
No, no, no, no, no
No I can't let 'em take me mane




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
It's (a million)

[Hook: Kanye West]
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone? 'Bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check
By check if "H to the Izzo" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mill, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!

[Hook: Kanye West]
How many years did I wait? About (a million)
How many niggas tryin' to hate? About (a million)
But when a nigga count his cake, it's 'bout (a million)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
'04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I supposed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice on the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Master Aces
"Stand Up", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
Chi-Town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!
(A million)

[Hook: Brandy]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

[Verse: Kanye West]
We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo inglés"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

[Bridge: Brandy]
What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

[Hook: Brandy]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down

I'm still, I'm still wet here tonight
So I will, make you cum through the night
Will you touch me? Will you go deep in me?
I will, in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

[Spoken Interlude: Mykki Blanco]
She’s a motherfuckin’ international sensation
She’s not your average showgirl
Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I'm still, I'm still wet here tonight
So I will, make you cum through the night
Will you touch me? Will you go deep in me?
I will, in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

[Bridge: Mykki Blanco]
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy

[Spoken Interlude: Mykki Blanco]
Save your tears honey
You’re a motherfucking diva
These banjee cunts can’t take you, Miss Taylor

[Outro from "Paris Is Burning" & Teyana Taylor]
I believe that there's a big future out there with a lot of beautiful things
I want so much more I want, I want my name to be a household product in the high fashion world
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy
Pussy

[Intro: D'banj]
Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering, -ing

[Chorus: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yeah, ayo, ayo
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see the smell, it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock, yo?

[Chorus: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a lake, chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
(Ohh!) Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All 'cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'Til the sky calls or its flames on us
Push

[Chorus: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: Cyhi the Prynce]
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Huh, fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Bridge: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
(Whooooa) Yeah, you feeling on top now
Getting that money nigga? (You, you sold your soul)
(Heeey) Yeah, you feeling on top now
(Heeey) Getting that money nigga? (You sold your soul)
(Whooooa) Yeah, you feeling on top now
Getting that money nigga?
(Heeey) Naw man, mad people was fronting
(Heeey) Aw man, made something from nothing

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. woulda been G.O.D. except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing




[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, fuck you nigga, you broke

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo it's a rebel rap as far as I'd like to rob

Come down dog, ain't nothin' personal dude

If you see me in the streets, better pack ya heat

[Intro]
Yo Hip-Hop, Is niggas still talkin bout I can't rap, come on now

[Verse 1]
Look for me, Young K
Took 2Pac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My Answers cost 350, ya nah'mean?
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend

[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend

[Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

That's Right (Kanye)

[Jay-Z] All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
Look for me
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
[Jay-Z] Yep!




[Refrain: Kanye]
Oh it can't Be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hopping out the limo or either the Lam B
But you niggas gon' get in 'til you get to Miami

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
GLC gon be stoned as Angie
I be Don C, Johnny Patron and me
It's a celebration bitches more bottles of cham-p-aign
In love with the same stripper that sprung T-Pain
And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn
Dawg I can't keep saying G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stunting out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep rising to the top like elevators
Hi haters I'm back off hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club with it come on homie they wilding
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we staying
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing

[Refrain]
Dawg it can't be
G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family
A little bit a stunting, flicking dawg it ain't deep
I'm only trying to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lakeshore Drive
The Grammy Family

[Verse 2: Consequence]
Oh no it can't be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hopping out the limo or either the Lam B
And after music meetings with Ebro and Angie
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we, be in Miami
So when they spot me and Bentley it's gon be a stampede
Cause we be racing Bentleys no different than Grand Prix
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the gloves and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And since I got my shot like I was calling "Man B"
A ho'll lose they spot and guaranteed a plan B
Will be waiting in the telly like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly painting they nails in nothing but they panties
And we'll be uptown like Jimmy and Cam be
Heading to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so platinum's the next step
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is
Oh, Oh, Oh, The Grammy Family

[John Legend]
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight
Oh it's alright, it's alright, yeah




[Verse 1: CyHi]
It may seem I'm sitting on a fortune
But sometimes money isn't so important
In my hood, I'm equivalent to Jordan
Dribbling on the court, but shawty I'm just recording
Fuck tricking, rather give it to an orphan
All you wanna do it hit the clit until it's sore, then
Get her pregnant, then neglect it
Then you go and tell the chick "get an abortion"
Them type of niggas Cyhi is not endorsing
They sitting down to take a leak, I'm pissing on the porcelain..
I'm from the South, but my parents are New Yorkin
Shouts out to Albany - I see you Uncle Norman!
Keep your family before friends
'Cause God is the only one that come before them
You got a nephew? Well, go support him!
You got some nieces, make sure that you adore them
I miss mine, cause I'm always out here touring
Or with the strippers at the Hilton up on Cortland
One from Utah, the other one from Portland
Throwin' on the Calliope, but I ain't from New Orleans
I can't lie, I lust for things
Like an old-school 'Lac or a Cut supreme
Or an iced-out G shock and a custom ring
And the freak with an ass that sits above her jeans

[Hook]
Woopty Doo!
Shawty stay caked up
Woopty Doo!
Just bought an Escalade truck
Woopty Doo!
You put some 26s on it
Woopty Doo!
Yo shit be looking pretty, don't it?
Woopty Doo!
You hit the club and make it rain
Woopty Doo!
You spend like 50 on the chain
But every 365 bro, you get a little wiser
And realize all that stupid shit bought was lame
Cause it don't mean shit, when you out there on your own
Cause it don't mean shit, when the Feds run in your home
Cause it don't mean shit, when you can't take care of your kids
Cause it don't mean shit, nigga, fuck what ya did
I tell them niggas "Woopty Doo! Woopty Doo! Woopty Doo!"
I tell them niggas "Woopty Doo! Woopty Doo! Woopty Doo!"

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Ok I'm rocking all gold
I feel like a fuckin' Pharoah from above
Bullets is bigger than fuckin' arrows
But in the middle of that peril
I'm still rocking new apparel
I just left the casino, I got money by the barrels
I feel like I'm Al Pacino
I'm counting Robert DiNero
If niggas want war, then best believe me that I'm there
You can catch me in the middle of that field like a scarecrow
Only difference is that a nigga's never scared ho
I'm tired of the cloudy days
I'm wishing for a sun
You would've thought that I was sterile
But I made it to the sky where angel asses erect us
Hollwood directors, Melrose dresses, ass that's the roundest
Toast another round up, but if I fell
Will they catch me before the ground does?
Who your real friends and friends by technicality?
They ask how your mama is, or ask for a salary?

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cyhi]
Patience is better than pride
So I'm riding factory without the leather inside
Half of y'all ain't got a car to put leather inside
Plus, the smaller the rim, the better the ride!
Suckers talk, but I never reply
Don't hate niggas, cause I've never been a confederate guy
So when I die, and look God dead in the eye
He said I got a room for you and a bed in the sky
But y'all can't get no capital cause y'all priorities fucked up
Part of the minority cause majority of us
Die by the gun and let authorities cuff us
Everyday is like "Glory" to us, bruh
So keep it cool shawty, I see the tool shawty
Niggas say they gangsta's but ain't never made the news
Call me Saint Lou cuz I'm giving y'all the Blues shawty
If you see me in the Lamb, then you know that Boo bought it
I was blessed to leave these streets
I took my first loss when I was 3 weeks deep
A lot of robbing if you not a goblin
I sold weed, but my partner rock a robin like "Twee lee lee"
Heroin and PCP
I had the kush, you want the mid, you had to see GB
So take it serious when you get money
Ain't shit funny, nigga, "hee hee hee!"

[Hook]




(Big Gipp)
You'se a baffoon, caught up in your own cocoon
Leave your head rest maroon
Drunk heavy in the side street saloon
Til' I figured it out, to the 3rd degree
I'm the milli in the meter
I'm the gram up in the kilo
I'm the wave up in the ocean
The C up in the coast and
The B up in the Boston
So what you looking for or looking at now
You ain't got what you gotta shake
Caught it on the sidewalk fake
I gets down, further digging down
Hurt for the red dirt at the same time
Hit rewind if your ass didn't hear me clear
Hit rewind if your ass didn't hear me clear

Hook

My old hood could use a little rebuilding
A better place for these ghetto children
I ain't gonna let 'em take the O out my JOY
Before you can rebuild, you've got to destroy
And these walls gonna come tumbling down
These walls gonna come tumbling down

(Cee-Lo)
Well I remember when, I was slanging nothing but weed
I ain't ??? round here that can't tell you about me
Fortunately I done changed the way I used to be
When so many didn't have an alternative to see
Music saved my life and now I'll never forget it
Thats why I try to glorify God with it
But it still remains, its in my veins
I know that I'mma sin, I just hope he'll forgive me again
Okay, I'm right and wrong in the same day
And it's always gonna be someone who'll see it the same way
And if I react, who was that guy to blame, hey
You fuck with me, I fuck with you thats how the game played
I had a choice to let it go, but if you don't let it go
Then I ain't got no choice no more
Two lives gone to waste, one dead and the other caught a case
With 50 years to face
Amazing Grace, I'm rebuilding

Hook

(T-Mo)
I'm so tired of my people not knowing what we doing to ourselves
And we blame it on them, but we stuck in the same frame
Trapped inside a mental instrumental bond
Hoping to run, but there's a gun, what could you really do
Everybody new kicking the old ??? to the floor
But now its more shit, crooked, shady, talking 'bout the president
He's fucking other ladies, blowing up spots we supposed to hit
And casually they spreading billions to the little children overseas
Niggas moving G's, I'm on my knees praying god please
A nigga just wanna eat and sleep
With my gun in my own little world and raise my little kids
Doing the best I can nigga

(Khujo)
Shit, look who talking now
You gots'ta crawl before you walk, Ohh don't follow too close
Where I think you might stop
We all can see that the grass is the same color on the other side of the fence
Give thanks, people thank alarm clocks, wake 'em up
Every morning brother I gotta stay prayed up
Cause the pistol ain't gonna save my life when it's time to go
Its just in case I get a chance to retaliate
I used ain't have nothing positive to say
Doing my little five minutes of fame
Who done forgot from which they came
Acknowledge his name, Lord, you've been so good to me
Better than I've been to myself
Keep us in good health
The white mans food makes my stomach upchuck
But I gots'ta be strong, to defeat my enemies
For the kill, MAC's in your side
Judging buildings, they can't be no playgrounds for these childrens

Hook




Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around

For most of our lives
It's been you and me
And I always thought
Nothing could come between
Obviously our friendship doesn't mean nothing to you
All this time I though I knew you, oh

[Trina & Tamera]
Half shirts, mini skirts
All of that ain't gon' work
So stop trying to flirt with my man
Before someone gets hurt

Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around

We were so close
How could you hurt me
You were my best friend
Where's your honesty
Thought you had my back
But that ain't where you at
See right through you
All this time I thought I knew you

For most of our lives
It's been you and me
And I always thought
Nothing could come between
Obviously our friendship doesn't mean nothing to you
All this time I though I knew you, oh

Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around

No way you could fool me
When he loves me truly
I can't believe I once called you a friend
Jo-Jo-Anne

[Eve]
I'm not the bitch to be tried
No remind, I'm makin' 'em cry
Cross the line with my property I'm walkin' up out
Treated you like a sister and you played games
Had to pull out the gangster showing you I'm running things
And I'm naming names
Practically raised you and made you
Classier than most know now I should have caved you
You thought he paged you, SURPRISE!
Heard me on the line
He told me everything about how you wasted his time and
How I cheated when I didn't
If it was given couldn't handle my position
Use your woman's intuition
Pick of the litter
Never compared, never could make me bitter
Compared to you I'll always be the bigger picture
Trying to be Eve, can never have it, act right
Four search parties be looking for you with a flashlight

[Trina]
No, Jo-Jo

Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around

[Intro: Rick James & James Brown]
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies-ladies and gentlemen

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Bridge: Kanye West & Rick James]
Run away from me, baby, ah, run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Then, run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Intro: Kanye West]
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real emcee
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
Oooooooh! OW!

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Charlie Wilson]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Such an easy morning, we on a ride
And I'm feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don’t want black people to think and drive

[Verse 2: Common]
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather wasn’t barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music and forever we hot?
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Bridge: Kanye West]
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop
(Can’t stop, you can’t stop)
This goes out to the all core hip-hop
(Can’t stop, you can’t stop)

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
As Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He’s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Selling kilos through your iPod Nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury’s handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh! In 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in
While haters wish death upon me, that’s many men
Yeah, and if he slam you on your paper route
Stop talking, motherfucker, pull your paper out

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Charlie Wilson]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Verse 5  Big Sean]
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don’t worry, we gon' be here all night
And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside)
Westside, Westside
So t-t-tell me who the freshest of them all?
They claiming that they fresh, they ain’t fresher than my balls
A nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball
Emcee hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from A's to B's to C's
All over double D's, I be absent all week
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for
Man, that’s the fam, we let ‘em in through the side door
Hold on, that’s the girl you gave a wedding ring?
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything

[Interlude: Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]
And let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
And let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
(As promised!)

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Now put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evening
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
I know the city getting ready for me

[Intro: Kanye West & (D'Banj)]
GOOD Music, Yeezy
(I'm D'Banj)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If you ask me
Anybody who ain’t tell you you was beautiful today need their ass beat
As we proceed, Island breeze, light the weed
I couldn’t find the words on how I feel
But what I lacked in skill I made up for in real
Time, the most precious thing a man could give
Because what she givn' back is why that man can live
We need to take a break, minus the screech, oh
Find a resort, what? Private beach, Oooh
Pina colada sippin', by the sunset
My mission is to find every position, we ain't done yet

[Hook : D'banj]
Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me di Iyawo mi
Cause you love me

I will be your Scape goat honey
Cause you came through for me
You gave me break through baby (x2)

[Verse 2: D'banj]
Baby Boo I can see your eyes
Say you don jam many fools for your life
Them go come as lovers as them disguise
But as time goes by, na your body be the price
Your back side sef...wey you carry na die
That's why sometimes I no dey surprise
Them go say them love you but that na lie
Chop and clean mouth, tell you bye bye
Me sef i no tell you say na me holy pass
Some people dey talk say i dey use jazz
Them say I bush, Some say I razz
Them say I be nobody, I no get class, Well
I've been bad and I know it and I'm sorry - wanna show it
But no one would give me a chance to prove myself
Despite what you've heard of me
You still went ahead to be with me
You have chosen to be there for me
To you, I make this vow
I say...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You getting louder than a two year old drumset
That's a mean gift, you work a mean stick
You’re like a phoenix, you could be my phoenix
Just rub your hands all over my v-neck
Swag, swag on Mach 5
Pac, 'cause don't it feel like Pac alive?
Feel my apocalypse, feel like I could just
Touch heaven with a Goddess in my fingertips
And I’m just trying to kiss every single lips
Hey Yeezy, what’s your next single is?
That D'banj causing hysteria
Soon as we hop of the plane in Nigeria

[Hook]

[Outro]
Omo toh good oh (toh good oh)
Oh nice oh (toh good oh)
Omo toh clean oh (toh clean oh)
Omo to set oh (toh set oh)
Toh sweet oh (toh sweet oh)




[Hook 1]
They gossiping, it runs the city
They don't know who watchin them when they comin to get me
So I hit the block and bend, do about sixty
And I put my Glocks to them, like blaow, blaow, blaow

[Verse 1]
I'm finna get on this TV and put shit down
I ain't finna let these light skinned niggas come back in style
I'm finna turn this class clown shit to crazy G's
They told my Momma I was bipolar, had A.D.D
I told 'em w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hating on you to their mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the ten-karat gold
That get green on you, when you get green on 'em
You gotta wash your hands of 'em, get clean on 'em
Somebody told me success is the best revenge
So they gon' be fucked up when you do your thing on 'em
Now hold your plaques high, like who would've thought?
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support

[Hook 2]
They are the dream killers, they the dream killers
Who know a dream? Uh, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
They the dream killers, they the dream killers
Dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)

[Verse 2]
Now how you going to talk about the way I spend my money?
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hating, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'Cause we the leaders and they the followers
And we the nut busters and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit, dog, and they the flies
How you gonna tell me how to live my life?
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right?
They are the misery that loves company
'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told 'em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said, "Oh you graduated?" Nah, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship then break your marriage up
Can't kill your dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay you or embarrass you
Come around with you but they ain't down with you
They the dream killers

[Instrumental Break]

(Killer Norman Bates)

[Verse 3]
And I'm through spitting these rappers my most heartfelt flow
'Cause they be like, "That's cool, you got some beats for me though?"
Oh, I get it, you want to be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say
Anyway, what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out your house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put your fist to your spouse, so how you gon' move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even taking wagers in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon' be like, "Peace?"
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the East
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York? What, you ain't never took a tour there?
What, you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?
The dream killers

[Hook 1]
They gossiping, it runs the city
They don't know who watchin them when they comin to get me
So I hit the block and bend, do about sixty
And I put my Glocks to them, like blaow, blaow, blaow




YO!

[Verse 1]
Good evening ladies and gents, close and distant fam
Let me break it down for ya'll exactly who I am...(CAV)
That brotha straight off of Myrtle Ave
That dude that make the other dude say that's my man, (CAV)
It ain't nuttin' I want I can't have
The haters know it's real and that's why they mad
They struggle so hard while I just lay back
They sound under pressure, sweaty and straight wack
I rock like this because I ain't that, (CAV)
Tell the players I'm taking the game back...
Matta fact tell the coaches, the GMs, and owners
Shut down the stadiums, it's over
I make the cat's in the back draw closer
Get the comp choked up like white folks on Oprah
Yeah you dope, but (CAV) it's more doper
More skill, more style, and more focus
I hit the lab with good shit to smoke up
And tell the sound man where I wanna go from
Blow up, skit sheet across the notepad
School em' all from the drop out to post grads
What history book you do or don't have
There's only two eras of rap, pre and post CAV
Now you know that
Stop the train, there's no place for the game left to go at

[Hook]
Cavee is my name but you can call me, (CAV)
It's all the same abbreviated or whole
Shout it out so it don't be a secret to folk it go, (CAV)
Short for Cavee but I'm not from Cali
I'm from the rotten apple, dirty streets and alleys
Bed-Stuy Brooklyn doin' it exactly, Get at me!!!

[Verse 2]
Holla!!...Like Missy and Ja Rule
Ain't a crowd in the world that CAV cannot move
Hot dude, cats was thinkin' it's not true
But come front row at the show, I got proof
I went from sellin' candy in junior high school
To servin' spoony g for the fiends to gnaw to
Got sent upstate on a bus, (Not cool)
In the yard thinkin' damn should've listen to ma duke
Come home in 99, what the fuck I'm gonna do
I won't move bundles, I got a new hustle
I quit pie baking, started rhyme makin
Buildin' up my rep to be one of the five greatest
And I ain't saying CAV the best nigga out there
But until he appear, I'm sittin' in his chair
And I'mma need a few moments just to get in ya'll ear
To make you forget that dude was ever even here
I got two words for the world: Be prepared
I got three words for your girl: Don't be scared!
And when they ask where the real hip-hop, IT'S OVER HERE!
And when they ask where Brooklyn at, HOLD YA EARS!
It's like YEAH! Chris Antione Vashon
Capricorn hit em' off with the classic bong and then I'm gone...

Ridin' back to Brook-Lan... boyeeeeee




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kanye West]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees."
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!"

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again




[Intro: The Dream]
Look at your money, ooh momma, this could be you
On the right side of this drop
Ooh momma, throw it in reverse
I call that back it up and drop a
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Dream]
Ohh, girl, I think that she like
I got that shit that make niggas want fight
I got that shit that make bitches act right
Make bitches act out of spite, aight
Ohh momma, I got that bomb
I got that shit make your ass go run
My shit knock, make niggas get guns
But the white girls say, "Where you get that cool beat from?"

[Pre-Chorus: The Dream]
She love it (she love it)
Every beat of the drum, she sprung
She say I make her wanna touch it, she love it (she love it)
She make me wanna touch it, I love it (I love it)

[Chorus: The Dream]
We buzzin', yeah
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yeah, I've been known to chase 'em, known to replace 'em
Shoe game outta this world, I outer space 'em
Known to have a hundred and one, like Dalmatians
Maybe if she special enough, I'll glass case her
Get caught cheating and I gotta let you stick me up
Let you shop 'til you drop as a pick-me-up
Bergdorf bandit, Barney's for the burglary
But these bands lift the whole store like Hercules
Get raunchy in Givenchy, my palm reads
Passports, Pinot Noir in arm's reach
Paddle shiftin', push-button, no car keys
The penthouses are poolside with palm trees

[Pre-Chorus: The Dream]
She love it (she love it)
Every beat of the drum, she sprung
She say I make her wanna touch it, she love it (she love it)
She make me wanna touch it, I love it (I love it)

[Chorus: The Dream]
We buzzin', yeah
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Uh, one-two, one-two, guess who back again
Uh, Harlem in this-what? Yeezy let Manhattan in
Get my mic right, turn my levels up
Get the light right, turn my bezel up
You either bounce on it, go 'head throw your mouth on it
So many ghosts in my garage they think my house haunted
Long as my buckle say Hermes, the rumors I'm not concerned with
They wanna garnish my earnings before I send it I burn it
You know them people too convinced that my money's gettin' rinsed
Her Lou B's seven inch, they TMZ me through my tint
I bumped into Loon he like, "Well, as-salamu alaykum"
You know I ain't Muslim my nigga, I'm about my bacon
The shot niggas takin' you'd think I'm rollin' 'round with Reagan
A Mexican landscaping couldn't rake in what I'm makin'
Think you blew me up with your bougie butt
But you ain't slow me up, I'm on the charts, you move me up
I'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard
It's hard to believe dollar sign e-even know the Lord
Already wrote it off, so just ignore the cost
So when I'm rollin' off I'm showin' off with no remorse
Shamone!

[Chorus: The Dream]
We buzzin', yeah
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Bitch hold smoke longer
Chokehold so strong, broke your armor
Now you're wide open, right?
You ain't even smokin' right
Bitch hold the smoke
Cough hope, Harpo
Purple gotcha knocked out, now you know you're smokin' loud
You're higher than a motherfucker
High in this bitch, high as a motherfucker
I'm high and this bitch fine as a motherfucker
I'm high as a motherfucker
I hear sirens, she dying in this motherfucker
Moment of silence for this motherfucker
I'm just higher than a motherfucker
I'm higher than a motherfucker
I'm higher than a mother




Or I make the life
I was very rich
Already

But if I think back to when I was making the College Dropout, thinking was this what I expected?
I mean, I didn’t expect the losses and you expect everything to work out well
But I expected real life
And then I suffered the worst pains to help me to grow
So those experiences, I never ask to take them away from me
Because they’re all in God’s plan and help make me the man I am today
And help make me more of a soldier and a vessel
Because if I hadn’t suffered those losses, I might be scared or too scared to fight the war on traditional thinking

[Intro]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me "baby"
And if you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, like we always do at this time

[Hook]
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I, gotta go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
Imma get on the TV momma and I'mma
Yo, I'mma put shit down
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) ayyy
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) [I'm good]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the good life, where homies who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Man, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, [it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A. it feel like Miami
[It feel like N.Y. summertime Chi
Ahhhhh! Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk,I pop the hood - Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look - sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo it's gots to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks - Lawry's
50 told me [go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate, watch the money pile up


[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life! Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got mo' (ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Philly
It feel like D.C. it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ayy!
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin money's not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
I always had a passion for flashin
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined
The good life

Everybody wants the good life
Welcome to the good life
Let me hear you say:
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!
Better than the life I lived
When I though that I was gonna go crazy

[Hook x3]




[Statik Selektah]
This shit right here is called The Return Of Malcolm
Don't take it too personal. Listen close

[Royce]
I feel like I'm at the height of my jump while y'all pivotin'
While y'all visitin' I'm livin' here, ball in a year
The hundreds and fifties in cheeseburgers
The twenties is balled up
You lookin' for singles they all in the air
The hundreds of bitches that we murdered
We ain't literally speakin'
We just team up and we squirt all up in they hair
Give us some coke and a promise
Give us some nut in the throat
She suck till she spittin' up coconut vomit
Get it?
Pardon me miss
I'm just fed up with the way the system is set up
The shit that they had me livin' in prison was better
Rhymin' perfection
Is it a set up?
To give me a year in the county around the time of election?
Or should I just shut up?
Zip it or kick it?
Try to get you to picture the vision
Lyrically, this is my petition to picket
Free me or, eventually see me
The heat in my belt hangs an inch from my pee pee like a key to my cell
To censor me is to censor my CD which inspires me
To spit what will eventually be the key to myself
Times is changin'
Everybody's Gods the same
But they minds ain't
So I talk about they kind is dangerous
Blacks against Affirmative Action sounds as insane
As the war in Iraq while Saddam is hangin'
A dead man's a dead man
Ain't two of a kind
You can't break me
I'm head standin' doin' my time
It's nothin'
My crew bakin' my bread while I'm jail
Had niggas buffin' my boots and makin' my bed
Time will tell who down to bail
If you gettin' down and how wild your arms will flail
When I bomb I unwind like I'm a spawn from hell
The only shots you takin' are those that evolve from shells
(The following name has been edited to keep the peace)
Something is on your mind then nigga say it
You scared?
If I was tryin' to X you out then you know you'd be dead
You need beef with me like you need a hole in your head
You little Stone Throwers
You signed-to-a-label-ass-niggas ain't sayin' shit till you own yours
Whenever them triggers is buckin'
I got to write a label to Trojan requestin' them niggas to up it
Cause my dick get bigger
My balls get larger
To a size that my drawers can't swallow
For y'all it suicide
The verbal amphetamine
The quotes is cold places, inserted with Ketamine
Spoken, they pulsate
Earthquake
Houston we got a problem
I'm settin' your turf straight
Your troops I private piles 'em up
The holocaust (cost) you pay is Hitler's
Way
You dis me, and get merked for Christmas
But the curse if gift less
I'm the first to spit shit
From a podium
Go to your local church to get this
Y'all sell chickens I only serve the biscuit
Leave your blood on the street
You get curbed with blisters
Chicken noodle soup your brains, let it rain
And I clear it out
All the vets say I'm official
And you can ask Diddy
But now that I'm doing time like Shyne
Nigga I'll probably +Press Play+ on a pistol
Political prisoner
Got ammo around my torso like Rambo
Banana around my waist like I'mma gorilla
It's time to apply my pace now on the fo' rilla
Bandanna around my face like dead prez

[Woman's voice]

[Royce]
Take a breather

You are now ridin' with a flow the fliest
Selassie inside
Who Jesus chose
Who Hov inspires
Extreme formula in this chess game
Accept change
You the king
We the queen corner a
Best thing spittin' since a geyser
The methane rhythm, it's supplier
Written with the fire
Doused by the best team
With him when he ridin'
Out
Cause the check flame when it get divided
Bout
Niggas livin' through decisions
Learnin' ain't givin' you the business
Quittin' is a privilege
Suited at a funeral, killin' any witness
Over dead prez's
I'm here to view the digits
Clearin' out the air space
Pointin' out who ain't dead
Gods gift to this world
I'm going out with reindeer
Comin' back and bang ya
Leap Year is a thang of the past
When I return and spring from my ashes
Like a deranged angel
Who came cause you asked
But I ain't here to save you, I came for your ass
It's sorta like the reaper
Blowin' at your concert
We write through the speakers
Knowin' that it's God's work
Rap is a prison that'll trap you in freedom
The contradiction of your past
The after you see Him
I don't have to proceed with no master's degree
To change the art
I came and waxed the museum
I saw, I conquered
I paused my disc to do a bid
So y'all can spit bout how you do it big
Nigga is you grown or you a kid?
You trash
And don't make me blast
And turn your dome into a lid
Open your mind
Put led in your brain
You dope for your time
I'm ahead of your game
The door's open
And I'm in it
I'm so focused
You still focusin'
And when I'm finished you gonna be hopin' it still opens
Maybe I lucked up?
Either I'm straight crazy or slavery got a nigga fucked up
Eminem and Kramer
The minimum will blame 'em
The average nigga got the word spinnin' in they chambers
The average nigga raised by the average nigga, aye
It's the average nigga way
To say "nigga" with an "a"
Riddle 'em and hit 'em with the K
Let it speak when he fiddle with the trigger
Let 'em kill 'em with the say
Sodom or Gomorrah
Which one are you the more of?
Chevy's sittin' on 30's and 20's on the Saurus
Fiendin' for that spot
The money bout to burn a hole in my pocket
So I got to extinguish that with a "Blao"
Put it out with a Phantom
Bring it out on the block
With no driver
Hoes, y'all wanna drive or not!
I gotta peel the peddle
A lot of troops done died
Why deal with the devil, knowin' I got a truce with God?
Gotta peel the peddle
A lot of troops done died
Why deal with the devil, knowin' I got a truce with God?
I gotta peel the peddle
A lot of troops done died
Why deal with the devil, knowin' that I got a truce with God?

[Intro: Beenie Man]
Relivin' the past?
Your loss!

[Verse 1: King Louie]
Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night, my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have

[Intro: Jadakiss:]
Ah-ha

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah)
She said I brought some friends with me, but I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
She said I brought some friends with me, but I don't know why (yeah)
Because they ain't gettin in with me (yo)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
You know me, I'm with a ghetto diva, stiletto fever
Jell-o shots, yellow reefer
Same rules apply, I'm back on top
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin shots of Patron, gettin top on yachts
The medallion's a mountain, rock on rocks
The whole world wanna know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt, she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't give brains, I told her let me get some knowledge of self
Then I told her be proud of yourself and dig deep
And try to see what you could get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back
The Ferrari truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn' if I call back, what

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah)
She said I brought some friends with me, but I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
She said I brought some friends with me, but I don't know why (yeah)
Because they ain't gettin in with me (yo)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, Kanye to the, yeah
I'm with this bad Ethiopian chick, drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, a straight up nigga
Now is it just me, or do them Uggs
Have girls feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs?
Some rhyme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
'Cause I'm, I'm tryin' to make it to Uranus
See that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin' to figure out since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year, me or LeBron James?
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money 'til you broke, my nigga live your life!

[Interlude: Jadakiss]
Ah-ha!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah)
She said I brought some friends with me, but I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)
She said I brought some friends with me, but I don't know why (yeah)
Because they ain't gettin in with me (yo)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin it in with me, 600 Benz with me
She wanna spend with me, uhh
She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club
Cause I got my mens with me, uhh
She said she leavin her friends for me
They ain't gettin in with her, cause she gon' bend for me, uhh
Her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me
Look like a ten for me, uhh
Now shorty is out with me, usin her mouth for me
She lookin out for me, uhh
She said 'Kiss where you live, I said you see the Bridge
When you step on the balcony, let's go

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Shorty gettin it in with me (uh-huh)

Ah-ha!




[Kanye West]
And you say Chi city
And you say Chi city
I'm down with Chops in Philly
Nothin' really just to Roc, me, Free and Mac Milli

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Listen, yo
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim, it's stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I can't restrain they real
I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats
I could have ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
Plus I'm killin' these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips
Dawg I'm killin' these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips
Changing lanes
Yeah, I'm changing lanes

[Verse 2: Chops]
And you say West Philly
And you say West Philly
I'm down with Kanye and Chi City
Nothing really, just Chops with beats to smack you silly
Listen

Let it be said and let it be known: without a touch of ego
The Chops is out your league like Pete Rose
To see most of these Joe's that make beats
Their flows is type-weak yo, like Shaq on the free throw
The difference between them and me though
Is similar to Big Pun and Suave Rico
Cause they beef oh, artificial like insemination - in vitro
When I bust like a depot, I be colder than December when the heat cold
Cool breeze leave the street froze
Quantum leap over these freak shows, I be unique yo
And check the stink, it fucking reeks so
Instead of making money, making music, that's the creed oh
On the D-low stack chips and lay like Frito's
Instead of making money, making music, that's the creed oh
On the D-low stack chips and lay like Frito's
Changing lanes




Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.




[Intro]
First you get the respect and then you get the money
After you get the money, that's when the power come
You dig?

[Verse 1]
I'm only 23, living like I'm 32
I just made a 100K and spent it all out with my crew
I be blowing money fast, what the fuck I'm supposed to do?
All this paper I done made, I can't take it to the grave
In a R8 Audi with the motor in the rear
I was nominated youngest baller of the year
Just think a couple months ago, I was locked up on the tier
In a cell but now I'm dropping on these niggas like a tear
For the way I got that Lambo in the back of me
Phantom in the front  of me
Stunting on my old hoes, look what this money done to me
Shout out all them niggas in my hood that ever fronted me
Cause I'm a put them all on and better they run to me
Cause real niggas do real things
If you was real you would've went and bought a real chain (Fraud)
Fake ass niggas playing in the real game
Frontin' on they old block, saying that the deal came
They asking how I get all this power
Cause I be on the grind like 24 hours (Yes sir)
365 dream chasing for a dollar, I been here since yesterday, I ain't even take a shower
More money more power, more power, more business, more bitches
Tryna holla when they see you by the dollar
And the problem when you on that cake
And when you shine, a lot of niggas they be on that hate
If I don't grind then who the fuck gon' put it on my plate?
She say I'm Hollywood, well shit I must be on my way
With my Louis luggage straight to Californ-ia
I hit my nigga K, like meet me by the port by eight
Uh, I had a dream like Mr. King
That I was in a phantom, color Listerine (Ew)
No top, bald headed like Mr. Clean
Shit I ain't claiming these bitches like Billie Jean
I'm just doing something to these niggas really mean
He got the money without the power, what do he mean?
He like the nigga that ride the bench that's playing for a team
That win the champ ain't get no ticks but he still get the rings

[Outro]
You dig me?
You like a nigga
Ya'll niggas got five rings
But you been riding the bench for five years
So that don't make you a nigga with power
You know what I mean?
That don't make you a Kobe nigga
Cause you was riding the bench while niggas was putting in the work
But you was just there and got the rings
You dig me?
That's like a nigga with no power, I'm gone




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When The Dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melyssa Ford
'94 I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest
Where you at? The whole city behind us

[Hook: Kanye West]
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Where you at? The whole city behind us

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
To shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights
May be long days but it's fright nights
Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'
Not the club; I stay in the get right!
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The-Game]
It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin column
Of Impalas in to get holla
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college, got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
To all the Y.G.s in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every color like Ice-T
I might be the city of Compton's right knee
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf
Of Luda and Kanyeezy, I'm gon' breathe easy

[Hook] - repeat 2X




[Intro: Travis Scott, Pharrell Williams, Kevin Parker & The Weeknd]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Louder (Louder)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (Uhh, yeah)
It's like standing in the ocean

[Verse: Travis Scott,  Pharrell Williams, & The Weeknd]
We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
Just let this wash on me
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

[Bridge: The Weeknd & Pharrell Williams]
Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams, Travis Scott, Kevin Parker & The Weeknd]
Standing in the ocean (Standing in the ocean)
(Ooh)
Bad memories like waves
Echoing (Echoing), echoing
Standing in the ocean
(Oh, baby)
Standing in the ocean
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed




[Hook: Kanye West + Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(That's that crack music nigga)
(That real black music nigga)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was "Heron"
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack, raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We, invested in that, it's like we got Merrill Lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree, ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends, cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
From the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove cause
Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
...and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

[Hook]

[Kanye West]
God, how could you let this happen *echoes*

[Verse 3: Game]
I'm comin' from the the the projects
Air 1's crackin' the ground
It's Kanye with that immaculate sound
Im right here ain't no backing me down
Hands on the hot hood Compton sheriff's pattin' me down
They wanna know about the Summerjam beef with 50
So I reach for my license inside my Dickies
Mr. officer after this autograph for ya daughter
Can you back the fuck away from my Aston Martin
I got places to see and people to do
Teairra Mari, I fucked Brooke Valentine too
This is crack music, I break her back to it
And tommorrow she can take my name and tattoo it
She see the hood in a nigga
If she look hard enough she can see the fuck[?] in a nigga
She ain't mad she know what's good in a nigga
Matter of fact she know that it's just rap and the fact is

[Hook x3]

[Outro: Malik Yusef]
Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin somethin on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin up this here crack music




[Intro: Mos Def]

Love the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are
The human heart is curious
Above all things, love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh howwwwww, I want you right now

[Verse 3: Kanye West  with Mos Def]
Don't tell me, you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girl
"Ah da da da da," That's how the fuck you sound
You drunk and hot girl, yeah
You only live once, do whatever you like
I thought I'd be with you for only one night
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
That drunk and hot girl

[Hook: Kanye West with Mos Def]

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever—first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown—Nino
She insist she got more class—we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me—Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled—chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal—I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness—bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money; Benjamin Button "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world, like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me, when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me – no, you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class: Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello—it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top!"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go—packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go—Macadamian—they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow—fuck no!
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over—oh, no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth-fillings
Come flyin' up outta our mouths—now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me—how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake—

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane




[Verse]
Just another one champion sound
We about to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now
Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound
Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American Boy




[Hook: Jill Scott]
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
America, you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual 
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can’t hear it over gun play 
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof
So we still lose

[Hook: Jill Scott]
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

[Bridge: Jill Scott]
It’s more and more and more than Baltimore
From shore to shore, oh lord
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

[Hook: Jill Scott]
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long




[Hook x2: (Ray Charles) and Kanye West]
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke, broke

[Bridge: (Ray Charles) and Kanye West]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm
And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad a---- to ShowBiz
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you f------ with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to f--- with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Hook: (Ray Charles) and Kanye West]
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke n-----, uh

[Bridge: (Ray Charles) and Kanye West]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!)
Yeah, it's something that you need to have
When she leave your a-- she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

[Hook x2: Kanye West and (Ray Charles)]
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke n-----. uh

[Bridge]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, you gotta roll up ya sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And y'all gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' a-- for a white girl

[Bridge: Kanye West and (Ray Charles)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Outro: Kanye West]
And that is the story of the Gold Diggers, boys and girls




[Intro: Kanye West]
I mean wow. You know? Man

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say "I know"
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like "Hey, you might like this"
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, "Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle"

[Verse 2: Patti Labelle]
Time, they say (true story, [kanye west])
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in His time
The pain you carry
Will be left far behind

[Pre-Hook: (Patti Labelle) and Mary Mary]
If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
You will see the many blessings (blessings you have received)
When you give Him all the glory (glory)
Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee)
Listen to all the stories
Meant to sing Your name

[Hook]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 3: Patti Labelle]
You try to please everyone
Time to live your life
Release those old illusions
Stop wasting time and
Start embracing
His light and let it shine

[Verse 4: Patti Labelle]
(Don't you listen) when they say
(You won't make it) oh it ain't no way
(Through the madness) never stop believing in yourself
In the morning you'll see
All the answers that free
You from chains that would seem
To keep you standing still

[Hook]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 5: Consequence]
I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams

[Hook x2]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your a child of The King
And I can do anything

[Outro]
Oh yes I can
Yes I can
I can do all things [?]
Nobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth
You're a child of The King
Never stop believing in yourself
The way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Stand up, stand up
And you can do anything
(Hallelujah)

[Intro: Otis Redding & JAY-Z]
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m 'bout to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450, I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never going to jail

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I made Jesus Walks, I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermès of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showing off
I'm done, I'll hit you up maña...nah!

[Verse 5: JAY-Z]
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubanos with Castro in cabanas
Viva México, cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can’t you see we gettin' money up under you?

[Verse 6: Kanye West, Jay-Z & Both]
Can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker read: "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chillin' (Uh), Ye is chillin' (Uh)
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne

[Outro]
Scream it
Give it
Scream it

[Intro: Labi Siffre]
Find your dreams come true

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right
A'ight?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you’ll ever find your dreams?




[Intro: Pusha-T]
You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

[Chorus: Pusha-T]
Millions-millions in the ceiling

This shit cook up hard, don't it?
Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like Boondocks
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah!

[Chorus: Pusha-T]
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

[Chorus: Pusha-T]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
This that shit y'all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches

[Chorus: Pusha-T]
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

[Outro]
This that shit that ya'll wanted

This shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I need my cash money
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli
These bitches is litty, my niggas is litty
We lit up the city, you feel me? (Feel me?)
My hitters is humble, we hit up the city
Then skrrt off and eat in a Bentley
Take her shoppin'
Can't get that python through customs
Hundred K for the PJ, fuck it
Garment bags, no luggage, feel me?
Getting money, you relate, feel me?
Bank account liftin' weights, feel me?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Flew in for the fight, that's that thug life
Pac sittin' shotgun next to Suge Knight
Coogi, Coogi, Coogi, Coogi on
Feel like I'm in the movie, holmes
Texted my Consigliere
Tell the maid leave the jacuzzi on
(Who you tryna get crazy with? Don't you know I'm loco?)
That Calabasas 'cross the sweatshirt
I wear it to a meetin' like a dress shirt
Top shotta put the pressure
Jamaican nigga with the mesh shirt
There's levels to my retail
The devil's in the detail
Niggas be typin' hard as hell
Goin' heavy metal on the email
Niggas be so emo
Catchin' feelings like a female
Get quiet as a church mouse
Phone soundin' like a seashell
Niggas get so choked up
I had to bring back the Spreewells, ha, ha, ha

[Chorus: Tyga & Kanye West]
We at the highest level, yeah I know you feel me (Feel me)
I'm at the dealership like what's the dealy?
Usher Raymond chain, it's too chilly
Usher Raymond chain, it's too chilly!

Usher Raymond chain, it's too chilly!

(La, la, la, la, la)




[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Target practice, baby
Only thing is
I'm not the shooter
I'm the bullet bitch

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up, I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history e'ry day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

[Hook]
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, what you want
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, i'm on that dry cush
And when it comes to that paper i stack books
Yeah, You heard what i said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap, you're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee, shoutout my nigga Fee
See every muthafucka at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin in, so tell me what you see
Its about money, it's bigger than me
I told my homies, "Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me," yeah
Don't miss, you fuckin with the hitmen
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

[Hook]
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's more because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Hook]
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question right?)
'Fore you knock the boy, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
(Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up)

Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cardi's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry

Ohh, don't act like you care about me
Ohh, don’t act like you care about me (Care about me)
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)
Don't act like you care about me, don’t act like you care about me
Saved by the bell

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Fuck it, you only live once (Woo)
Done with all the stuntin' down the pipeline (You)
'Cept for a nigga like me (Ugh)
I done lived at least eight lifetimes (You)
Bitch, you got too much jokes (You lose)

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Oh, Ye, oh, Ye, what you talkin’ 'bout?
In the front verse, oh, you should walk it out
I don't even give a fuck if you talkin' 'bout
What the fuck you want that fame, what you talkin' 'bout me?
I'm singin' this lowkey, you sittin' here before me
Everytime that you phone me
And I'm feelin' like a worst guy, had me feelin' like it's rest time
Listen, baby, for me, listen, baby, for me
I just want that bag if you add it, I just want to know if you ridin'
I just want free time that we on this
I just feel like we come with that low shit
If you wanna sip on that Bud Light, on that Bud Light
If you wanna get here, get your love right if you're alright

[Break: Kanye West]
I'm so glad, I'm so glad
I'm so high, uh, I'm so high
They so mad, uh, I'm so high

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ohh, don't act like you care about me
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)

[Verse 4: Post Malone]
And I want a 20 on my chain, it dangles
Bands on me, I just might fuck your bitch like Bang Bros
So much jewelry on my neck, my fuckin' bank froze
And I wanna fuck it while I'm watchin' bank roll
Cut the roof off, you can't breathe when I smash it
Diamonds on funk and I bleed when I'm ashin'
Cut the roof off, you can't breathe when I smash it
Diamonds on funk and I bleed when I'm ashin'
Ride on my wrist, I got your ride on my wrist
Rollie on them bands when I ride on my wrist
Five on the fist, cop five on the fist
Then I want a fourty, got five on my wrist
And I know you're no snake, been fuckin' on my bae
I'm fuckin' up a check and I wonder why
Been down on-on the tracks and I'm flippin' on a bitch
I'm fuckin' up a check and I wonder why
And I musta be a bun digger chanter
And I musta cutta fund that I shot up
And I go, and I go, and I said I go
Hannibal, diamonds up, ain't no matter, though
Racks in the bank, it's up, I'm on the payroll
I'm the one, I choose to paper chase, baby
Racks in the bank, it's up, I'm on the payroll
I'm the one, I choose the paper

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ohh, don't act like you care about me
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)
Ohh




[Intro: Kanye West & Choir]
La la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah, that's pure, man

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
Uh, that's that crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Yeah, uh, yeah, that's that crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music, black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' a President, look there's hope, man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks, man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
Yeah, and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
Uh, crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music, black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Yeah, uh, uh, listen, that's that crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
You know, man, how good it feels to have strings for that chorus?

[Outro: Kanye West]
How could you let this happen?
Happen? Happen? Happen? Happen?




[Intro] [Kanye West talking]
Yo it's your boy, super pro-huhum, I mean super RAPPER Kanye West
I want to shout out all my Heavy Hitters. Yo, G & Hop what up?
[Verse 1]
Was it because of the Roc
That she wanna rock with West?
Because after the Blueprint I got lots of checks
She don't play X-Box but got a box of X
That make her tongue move faster than Das EFX
Uh, white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie they only fives but together they tens
And would I do them again?
Hummm, it's like old folks pissin' cause it all Depends
And there's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose will get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin'
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse them
Buyin' boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy choose 'em
And take 'em back to confuse 'em
See she don't know if she's comin' or goin'
Cause mommy after I'm cummin' I'm goin'
Back to the show
Just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin'
It's like somethin' outta nowhere
Yeah, and I've been known to have a ho or two
Cause my diamond's yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em, "Step into the vocal booth"
Roll a joint, smoke a few
After that I'm pokin' you
After that it's over boo
Baby grab your coat and peeeeuuuun
She said, "I love you K."
"I know you do. If I was you I'd love me too."
Yoooooooou
Not used to what I got to offer
Please get up off me baby, you can't boss me
I wish I would let her dictate
All she can tell me is how the dick taste
How she gonna tell K about L.A.?
When I got three hoes that stay in Marina Del Ray
Well paid, they don't park it, just valet
Waist small like the Motorola Cingular cell-y
Voice high like Mich'elle
I step back like, "Haha
You ever ran for Miss L.A.?"
Cause you holdin' down the city officia-lly
Next time you fuckin' your man, just yell, "K"

Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone 'til we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: "Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, "Let's do it"

[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)
(BIG! SEAN!)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say "Aye dawg, What you got?", "Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly
And if his song's good I'll reply

[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]
Trick Trick: Hello
Shorty: Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga
Trick Trick: Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?
Shorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg
Trick: What!
Shorty: Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye
Trick: Oh hell naw, what?
Shorty: Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man
Trick: Awwww Dang! Tight!
Shorty: Bet, He short as hell though
Both: Hahahaha
Shorty: But that nigga was cool though man
Trick: Alright!
Shorty: Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars

[Outro 1: Big Sean]
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry

[Outro 2: Mama Myra]
I know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha




[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Kanye West]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Bridge: Jeremih]
And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Chorus: Choir, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't feel like she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up (Why?)
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (Out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (Uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (Love me or hate me)

[Outro: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
For any guy that ever fucked up (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (Ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Intro: Ponderosa Twins Plus One & Brenda Lee]
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
Uh-huh, honey

[Refrain: Kanye West]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you s'posed to drown

[Chorus: Ponderosa Twins Plus One, Brenda Lee & Kanye West]
Bound to fall in love
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love (bound)
Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One & Brenda Lee]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh-huh, honey

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, & Brenda Lee]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Uh-huh, honey

[Mary J. Blige]
(*harmonizing*)
All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pavees, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see thous
But I'm gettin a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my life, so you can clearly see now

[Hook - Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin us is very special
Lovin life and life and livin
Your very special

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Ya'll can never be built like me, even if ya'll look at my blueprint
But since ya'll watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin that look like a nuisance
But ya'll gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence
But it look like the students are playin hooky, and truin
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like ya'll fluent
And ya'll done seen how this "Young'n" look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, ya'll crackers gonna blame it on strays

[Mary J. Blige]
Cause love and life, and life and livin
Your very special
(*harmonizing*)

[Hook] - w/ variations

(*harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special
(*harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special




[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, spit at the world
My lyrics, I could spit at your girl
Spit when I hurl, spit on the Dutch and finish the twirl
Spit facts, spit on wax my whole lifetime
Spit on my watch, make the ice shine
Spit trife lines, .44 spit slugs out
Ready to thug out at the clubhouse
Chickens who lickin' or spit a nut out
My name within itself is a language that bring you wealth
Careful, comin' at me's like hangin' yourself, at a.....
I know you thought I'd be locked up
Dead by now, shot up, full of lead by now
Got up with JD though, crazy dough
Queens with the So So Def, A-T-L's best (yeah I know)
Every ride up the 9-5, fly friendly skies
Thug passion for J Doves, Henny's for Nas
Then we mix that shit, tip that shit
Pass it around, hood to hood, everybody get with it

[Chorus:  Nas & Jermaine Dupri]
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Queensbridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause College Park is in the house
They call me Don Chi Chi and I turns it out

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
I'm sumpin' y'all dread like locks, get bread by the flocks
Bitches love me and I'm duggy from the head to the socks
Too much to handle, here the man of the year
Hit rooms and light 'em up like a chandelier
From C-P to the Bridge, y'all know what it is
Been gettin' money like this since I was a kid
I'm in the corner with bitches and buckets of Cris
Pourin' at the most goin'est nigga wit' shit that showin' it
Now look at my ice, look at your ice, DAMN!
Look at my life, look at your life, DAMN!
See, I got niggas wantin' to drop me, top me, stop me
Copy Chi to the T 'cause I'm nice in the 3 black same color AMG's
TV's, front and back pack with nuttin' but ladies
You can look up or down, right or left
But all you gon' hear and see is So So Def

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Nas]
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause College Park is in the house
They call me Don Chi Chi and I turns it out
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
'Cause Queensbridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out

[Verse 3: Nas]
Touch the whole global with cold vocals and dark words
Vocal cords translate what my drunk heart slurs
Chest clogged up with sparked up herb, I feel faint
Tryin' to hold myself together, coulda spilt my own drink
All I hear is beats bumpin', I'm seein' in doubles
Last thing I need to happen is to be in a scuffle
Where my dogs at? These ain't my niggas Allah
Help the guard, forgot my niggas took some girls to the car
Tryin' to make it through the crowd, which way is out?
Which way is around? These grimy motherfuckers pointin' me out
I wish I had the drink
But then I'm too intoxicated to aim and put the clip in
It's like the floor's wet and every step is like I'm slippin'
And yo, I can't lose a step, I feel my enemies followin'
All I got as a weapon is this Hennessy bottle
I'm talkin' to myself, my peoples should be stickin' with me
Somebody grabbed me up, "Yo Nas, come take this picture with me"
My ice strillon, I'm feelin' my arm
Thought my Rollie was gone, now I wanna swing but I'm calm
Still got that, DJ musta threw on another hot track
Think it was this one here, bounce to that
Too much Thug Passion and smokin'
Made it outside, mouth wide, vomittin', gaggin' and chokin'
From behind, niggas plottin' and scopin'
Everything was blurry at first, but now shit is movin' in slow motion
I saw my niggas pull up, Pirelli's they skidded
They open the car door and toss-ed me in it
Cats tried to rob me, the crowd was rowdy
But one thing's for sure, So So Def know how to party

[Outro]
All night long {?'til when?}?
Til the early morn (it don't stop)
And uh (it don't quit)
And uh (So So Def with the dope shit, bitch!)

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose
You lose, you lose
You lose, you lose

And I got paper to take you on trips to malls
Get you Prada till you fall
Till you tired of rockin it
Tiffani ain't cold till you tired of coppin it
Cold compressor, ma, I know you tired of droppin it
Here's the keys to the truck, cause they tired of watchin it
I know this world got all types of fools
Every whip with a stash box, for the fortunate have-nots
I know you said you can get me the six
With the deep dish buckets, but you know me, fuck it
I'd rather have you in my arms to hold on
Slanted out Benz, just getting our roll on
Look, me and you from Harlem to the South, so

And cop me the biggest diamond you can find me
Some Liberace shit that'll blind me, real shiny
Ten karats or better, nigga 'nuff, you tying me up
Cop me the ice blue Chacarda
Park the Bentley or larger in my front yard and
Shoppin sprees, coppin Frankie B's
Baby please, I stays wit major cheese
Give me the extra set of Mercedes keys

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Cosmopolitan Church of Prayer Choir]
Music in my ear (In my ear)
And in the midnight hours, yes, yes
It's Sweet Jesus (It's Sweet Jesus) telling me (Telling me)
He'll keep by my side
In the midnight hours, yes, yes




[Intro: The-Dream]
I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens
And they wanna bury me
Why? Cause I’m anti everything
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens

[Hook: Kanye West & A$AP Rocky]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
The three leading killers of you niggas
Is the shit that’s most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don’t let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn’t ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what’s the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won’t unveil it yet, can’t tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh

[Hook]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Yeah, I see your vision, sick of prison visits
Now the Major League’s where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can’t judge you ‘cause we ain’t hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
Make ‘em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you’re worth it
Real bitches worth it

[Hook]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I’ve been watching all you real niggas
I done seen more won't than you will niggas
Take a swing, snatch a chain
Lose your mind, go insane
I’m in the club, you in the club too
I got money, you got money too
You think it’s honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It’s no pictures, now you in your feelings
I’m a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
I get it done for quarter ki money, for real

[Hook]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know




Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams
Millions of people tryin' to get on the scene
And everyone sellin' their souls, everyone sellin' their...
Everyone sayin' they woke
But they sleepwalkin', dead, eyes closed

[Chorus]
L.A. monster
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Lord, save these people, they asleep
They lettin' Satan run they streets
Lord, save us from
L.A. monster
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Lord, save these people, they asleep
They lettin' Satan run they streets
Lord, save us from
L.A. monster

[Refrain]
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams
Millions of people tryin' to get on the scene
And everyone sellin' their souls, everyone sellin' their...
Everyone sayin' they woke
But they sleepwalkin', dead, eyes closed
L.A. monster
It's the ugliest nightmare born from the prettiest dreams
Millions of people tryin' to get on the scene
And everyone sellin' their souls, everyone sellin' their...
Everyone sayin' they woke
But they sleepwalkin', dead, eyes closed
L.A. monster

[Outro]
Jesus, save all my people
From this monster, 'fore it takes their souls
It gives false hope and eats them whole
Zip up your nest full, all still broke
Jesus, save all my people
From this monster, 'fore it takes their souls

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

Watch a player get straight
Got that Rosanne
Cause a player got weight
Call me Lieutenant Dan
Cause I got that Rosanne

[Verse 1: GLC]
Started with that 28
Moved it up to 56
Buck 50 crocodile hunter out here taking risks
I saw the video for Promise just like 50 Cent
Now I wanna hit Ciera just like 50 Cent
Call me Tom Cruise I'm on risky biz
Pulling hoes buying clothes And taking risks
Hit the Swaporama to get my ruler kit
Got another one from folks cause he wasn't using it
We was wearing Coogi the first time around
Now you wearing Coogi only cause the price come down
I got the Spizzikes you got the replicas
We up several flights please don't try to step with us
And we keep that pot call it Harry Potter
And we wearing minks you wearing a hairy otter
A German Shepard a sheared possum
I'm Batman you in Gotham
And we up them things not no boomerangs
And we talk our own language just like
Pooty Tang tippy tow why you tripping now
At first it was a drought but now the block is tipping now

[Hook: GLC]
From that one twelve to
That two twenty four
To that four forty eight
Watch a player get straight
Got that Rosanne
Cause a player got weight
Call me Lieutenant Dan
Cause I got that Rosanne
From that one twelve

[Verse 2: GLC]
Got it up to two two four
Them people watching me
My life is like the Truman Show
Rap phenomenon nigga ask Big O
Shoot that money dog
Tell me what they hitting for
A new car tons of reefer
And it's always selling out
Call it  Condoleezza
No we never bailing out I'm my brothers keeper
When I get to BET imma bone Juliesa
Yep I'm a young and eager
But I'm driving slow
I can take you through the Go and back
With my eyes closed
In another city traffic take the side roads
But we bringing all that traffic through
The side doors
I'm GLC like [?] Washington
I run the city I got the block on ten
Fuck you if you never thought that I can win
You ain't a hustler I expose you
I can not pretend




[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
How could He not be the greatest?
In my bed, under covers when undercovers had raided
My presence is happy belated
Fashionably late, I'm just glad that you made it
The best is yet to come, I'm just glad that you waited
They all say they real 'til it's time to appraise it
I seen them come and go, you only the latest
But who am I to judge? I'm crooked as Vegas

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

[Verse 2: No Malice]
A lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those
And in my arrogance, took a camera pose
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows
They sing a different tune when the slammer close
From the concrete grew a rose
They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk
Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost

[Saxophone Solo: Kenny G]

[Outro: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh-oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)
Oh-oh, oh, oh (Work, work, work, work)




[Ma$e]
This song right here changed my life... come on, come on!

[Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down

[Verse 1: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that

[Hook: Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Jesus walk with me, he walk with the sinners cause I know I am
But I ain't no loser, I'm a winner and I know I can
Overcome the devil for he get the best of me
My daddy always said G-O-D gon' have tests for me
Illegally they told me to lie when they question me
But God sent an angel that said the truth will set you free
So in the midst of getting sued for more than my deal
I admitted I fell asleep at the wheel
Cause I realized I could've died, he saved me
Every single hit that got played he gave me
People ask me "Do you read your Bible?"
"It could help out when you need revival"
There's something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And he give me direction when I can't decide
He is alive! How could you tell me that he ain't when I said



[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choice: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio is playing
Is because you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beasts will knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who be here for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it

[Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Ma$e]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me




[Verse]
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know

[Hook]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there

[Post-Hook]
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

[Hook]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there

[Post-Hook]
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

[Outro]
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
I don't know what else to say
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
Don't go live your life in vain




[Rhymefest] + (Kanye)
Yeah, this joint right here man, is for all my blue collar niggas
In the Midwest goin through our struggle
We know things could be better, huh
And we just want a little mooore

[Hook 2X: Kanye] + (Rhymefest)
No matter how much I get (I want mooore)
Even when I talk my shit (I want mooore)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this
But still (I want more)

[Rhymefest]
Look.. now I ain't goin for the okey-doke (nope)
You owe me dough?, you better pay me like you know we broke
This industry be tryin to strangle niggas in the choke
You think these rappers rich? These niggas out here sellin dope
You think it's crazy sayin, "If I had what he had"
But if you had what he had, nigga you'd be mad
Three kids, see dad broke-ass waitin on the royalties with no cash
Nice car, no gas, stuck at the pump
Had a lil' hot single now he's stuck in a slump
At the top of his section eight, straight waitin to jump
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Sayin "That's umm - I forgot his name - who is he?"
He wanted (mooore) never really thought of the loss
Lookin for (mooore) everybody playin the boss
To get (mooore) now he just stuck in the sauce
Like white kids when they got cut off, "Daddy I want.." (mooore)

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This go out to every man tryin to achieve and hold his own
Them ladies are nice, but you gotta leave them hoes alone
They'll take it and bro, break in your phone, call your boss up
(Where that nigga at?) Or tell your wife to try to break up your home
Now your baby momma takin your son, learn from mistakes I done
Yesterday we all naked and fun
I ain't thinkin of none, break in and cum, soon as you done run
This is real talk, nigga one-on-one
Between me and you, now this mano a mano
How you gon' catch mono from a ho that work at McDonald's
Now you lookin like the clown like Ronald
That's where Kells fucked up, cause young girls he decided to fondle
And I ain't fin' ta let HIV zip my bag
I started usin' rubbers again, it ain't that bad
You gotta take care of yourself mayne, don't get grabbed
Cause if you die, people be like "Aww that's too bad"
I want (mooore)

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Everybody so weak like, like, they afraid to speak
If you see that nigga violate then hit him in his cheek
Tryin to act like, like, you reppin the street
You ain't a gangsta, you a bitch with a beat
So it's time to make role call, then expose y'all
Adam & Eve shocked in the garden with no drawers
While niggas gettin popped on my block with no laws
I grew up with Disciples that'll smash ya gold off
I never plugged, cause I know that when you do that shit
You locked in for life, nigga yeah, etched in blood
But it's hard to get respect when you less than thug
And you ain't fin' to serve here if you ain't with us
Us meanin them, them meanin G.D
Gangster Disciples, the same ones that killed Cochise
So see, how he, well he, meanin me
Refused to be another nigga dead in the street
I wanted (mooore)

[Hook] - repeat 2X as music fades

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus]
Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little something, show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 1]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say "when you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus]
I think he did
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everything I wanted, man it seem so serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 2]
When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Bridge]
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus]
Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it, but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this... like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Intro: Mos Def]
History, it's happenin' every day, y'all (right now)
Everyday (live, right now)
Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Listen! Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, them niggas again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dopeman of hip-hop, now let's rock
Now roll out, niggas, my hometown niggas
I get it good in yo hood, so slow down, niggas
Watch the speed though, mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course with these walls
(BAM!) They don't move, don't pray, don't lose
Don't sleep, life passin', light flashin', life happens
That fast, part of done, black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear, dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year, it's another day
It's the same fight, different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory, you live it up, the beat'll get risen up
You're knocked down, then get back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it, from the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep, from the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact, for short, I MC
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [(Mos, nigga!)]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lye, carried a fo' five
Claimed I was ready to die, promised never to cry
Held it all inside, reality was too much to take, so I
Kept my mind fried, slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes, then I woke up behind
Thinkin' either I load up these 9's, or blow up with rhymes
‘Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein' your moms
Doin' five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me workin' McDonald's
I'd rather pull a MAC on you
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, but I'm packin', bye!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah! It's somethin' about that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up, this is the tree and the rope
This is Chi, nigga, I'm Mr. All-of-That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' fo', lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin' on, rap 'til we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me, "Toughen up, put some bass in your voice!"
They used to tell me, "Lighten up, put some Mase in your voice!"
Lord willin' I ain't killed nobody
But I have a feelin' this album that I'm gonna make a killin'
Or not a shilling, this is love-it-or-hate-it music
But—at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry, this is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me, or I'm finna be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more, we're makin' history

[Hook: background singers + (Talib Kweli)]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)
(Just to get by, just to get by)
(Just to get by), just to get get buh buh buh bye bye

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
We keep it gangsta, say 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
Desensitized by the violence on the TV during the war
Killin' each other is easy, its pourin' liquor for fallen niggas
Believe me, it's ghetto libation, seen it all before
Just to get by, my people, we get fly
My people, we get high, fillin' cigars with the lah
Nigga, come on! Even Jesus was stoned
Before receivin' the throne
I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin' fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin' on corners
Waitin' for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin' the week was good, so I could get money back
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street mothafuckas
And reach out to wifey, and then I place a call on my mother
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
*Ayo, Mom, pick up the phone, I gotta to talk to you, Ma*
If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin'
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session

[Hook: background singers + (Talib Kweli)]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

[Outro: Talib Kweli]
Some people try, some people try
Just to get by, for my piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie
And we keepin' it fly – yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
When people decice to keep a disguise
Can't see your eyes, see the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin' the signs









and I've seen a few things
take my life
and I love that she clings
on my arm real tight
bitch got the bangs
with the bleach coloured eyes
can't say no to a thing
that you do all the time

got that bitch on her back
and that shit be aching
breaking them bones
I could do with some waking
need a car of my own
so I can keep chasin you




[Verse 1]
I'm from a place where shit can never phase you
Day to night, so fast, the clyde paid you
You didn't have phase two, slip hat, steel wrist
Real reps, the street made due
I popped up so fresh for '88
Rep on the plate and still I never left my crew
I never sweat but other odd jobs I did do
I did two summers in BK, a feverish flu
I caught, I ought to be crazy the way I brought it back
Part of that was seeing it first hand and all of that
Came from my parents and rain from the sky
But it made them, ask me where they're from, I don't play dumb
I don't play no part that I can't finish off
I don't wait 'til your day start, I take it apart
I met so many others while I was on the come up
We from L.A., it's only natural we think we one up
We think we rise with the sun, we think we fall with the moon
We think we hot shit, we can't tell December from June
I'm not knockin' the land that got it poppin', it's true
Without L.A., you can't spell the name of my crew
I knew some others who knew someone in show biz
They introduced us, already know him
Her, different places, so many faces
Went to high school with Nicole Richie, she had braces
I could never fuck with school, wasn't into this
My other classmate was Mikey from Incubus
My other girl wasn't wifey, more like porno chick
My friend Alan, they now call him Alchemist
It's a trip, I think Ethan Brown made me rap
I be wonderin', "Dawg, where the fuck you at?"
Understandin' the red, that's how you get in the black
Some came up and some never makin' it back, back..

[Interlude]
Haha, yeah
You know I've seen a lot of people come up, right?
(DJ Skee)
Let me tell you 'bout it, come on, uh

[Verse 2]
John Legend and Michael with no car, yo
I guess that was a car, I don't really call that a car, though
I knew celebs before they blew, too many to count
I got news, nothin' new under the sun, you know I been out
I be keepin' with my peoples on the regular
And I be peepin' old friends who now competitors
I remember will.i.am was called Will 1 X
That's not a diss but I still got the tape in my deck
I got an old friend who made Celeb Rehab
I watch it, can't stop laughin', he plottin', coppin' three bags
I do me, I'm on the wave with a gift
A certain rapper don't remember when he didn't have a lift
I could bring up old dirt first, but now that's past tense
Side note: I knew Mark Ronson before the accent
Side note: It's 3 AM, I'm still rappin' (Thank you, thank you)
It's 3 AM, you're still clappin'
I met B-Real before "Time 4 Sum Aksion"
Knew the deal before people started askin'
Simple questions, never thought to ask before it happened
Do kush before the fashion
Got the green thumb between these gloves with the hash print
With the cash in hand and my passport stamped
Nothing I can't do, the new people's champ




Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Up from the ashes into the sky
Found a redeemer, how I survive
Voice of their mothers, Mary and Christ
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life
I could tell you, He could show you
God and Heaven shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to you empty, free of my pride

[Verse]
(Ooh, ooh)
He ain't goin'
He ain't tellin' none
We ain't goin'
We ain't tellin' none
Love keeps growin'
And love keeps spillin' over
I come to you empty, free of my pride

[Chorus]
Up from the ashes into the sky
Found a redeemer, how I survive
Voice of their mothers, Mary and Christ
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life
I could tell you, He could show you
God and Heaven shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to you empty free of my pride

[Outro]
I come to you empty

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bitch stop the comparisons

Narcissistic tendencies
With psychopathic pockets, bitch
My bank account is crazy, bitch

My straight jacket Giv-enchy-ahnchy-ahchy (Ooh!)
Can't even pronounce that shit
Designer jeans, designer drugs
Just bought me a designer bitch (Yeah!)
Why this bitch keep hittin' my line?
She knowin' she ain't no dime and shit (Nope!)
Knowin' I ain't got no time to waste
Be fuckin' around with no nickel bitch (Huh?!)
Your nigga pinchin' pennies
But I'm out here making these millions, bitch
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for
'Cause I got all the presidents (Racks!)
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie all day
She think she elegant (Mwah!)
It's an elephant in the room
Guess who's the mothafuckin' elephant? (It's Gucci)
Maybach in the garage
Elevator in the residence (Huh?)
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Me and Guwop, makin' super moves
Makin' stupid cash, stack it through the roof
You don't fuck with me? The feelin' mutual
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru
We hit the city, the old me goin' OC
How her friend only gonna watch that, that is so weak
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats
But I need that, in the sauna, in the bathroom, at your mama's
Like a porn star, I'm a monster; you a dancer, on the camera
In the G-string, girl, I want you; at the concert, at the condo
In my bedroom, in the guest room
In the restroom, fuck it, every room (Yeah!)
Tryna see that...

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Mwah!)
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Mwah!

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Kanye West]
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholeseller
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him, yuugh!
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I’m goin' four door

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah + Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Step on they necks 'til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
(Woo!) They shit is shoppin' at Targét
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (ay!)
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Hah)
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuuugh!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uhh
Cause we can't get along - no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough, to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since ‘94
I don’t know what I, I don’t know what y'all talkin’ bout
And my eagle — still got it all in the bag, B
Yeah, all I did was play possum
Yo, come on

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
600 Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven’t ate since 12, and it’s after seven
We feed the nigga like 40 chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin’ their wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I’m not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

[Outro: Kanye West]
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told
(I don't know but I've been told)
If you get fresh get all the hoes
(If you get fresh get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes
(I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody, please pick out they clothes
(Somebody, please pick out they clothes)
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!




[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Winter in America, never knew white Christmas
'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
Call it the lord’s name 'cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It’s war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don’t give them martyrs no more, they can’t defeat us
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The false flags fly at a half mast this morning
Take a bow, this might be your last performance

[Hook: Kanye West]
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

[Verse 2: Consequence]
The old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny
Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney
Might've been racist like the waitresses up in Denny’s
Swore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech
'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech
Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne
But veterans don’t get the benefit of feelin' at home
So maybe those projections out at Silicon
Are what drove her to get injections made of silicone
I swear it’s the killing season
'Cause killin' is still in season, yeah

[Verse 3: Jarobi]
Louder than a three pound, voices screaming mad to boot
It must be killing season, on the menu strangefruit
Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation
Whose states has grown bitter through justice expiration
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment
Things haven’t really changed
Or they're dormant for the moment
Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Been on the wrong team so much, can’t recognize a win
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Causes men to suffocate, I can’t breathe no more
Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally
Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly
Black soul bold enough, inner city cold enough
Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya




[Verse 1: Kanye West, DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
DJ Khaled, We The Best (Go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in

I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
Fuck nigga, you can't stop this!
Fuck the rest, we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled and Pain

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I go the hardest, flow so retarded
I'm disgusted with myself, I mean, were do I start
First I spin around and vomit, then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad, won't nobody get up on it
I flow sick, nigga how sick, seasick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I had some wins, some losses
Just a life of a God damn boss's
With the top off lookin' for a girl
With a ass as fat as Tracee Ross's
This is dope as it get
Dope as a motherfuckin' acid trip
Fly as fifty-seven passengers
This finna be another classic, bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it, no, I ain't goin' have it

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been the type to bite my words
When I came up y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Go head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she goin' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old, well it's good I'm young
Before my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's goin' be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing y'all got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm out of here

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!

[Interlude: Kanye West & DJ Khaled]
I think it's time for me to go hard as than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!




One glad morning
When this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land where
Joy shall never end
I'll fly away

Oh I'll fly away oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away




[Verse 1]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
And people say, “Oh, Ronald Reagan’s that president”
But type “Black Panther” and “Ronald Reagan”
And see what you get
Being that he was the governor of L.A
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil-Scott was hearing
Why all our heroes and heroines end up on heroin?
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that; it’s like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it; nowadays, they can’t tell if…
That’s that good shit? We ain’t sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue; yeah, that’s pure, man

[Chorus]
That’s that crack music
That real Black music
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 2]
From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricóns lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? “We just trying to party, homes”
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda; raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause… dreams of being Hova
Went from being a broke man to being a dopeman
To being the President; look, there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that
Crack music!




[Intro]
Ooh I promise not to do it again
I promise not to do it

[Verse 1: John Legend]
You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
Cause you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do
Like erase my phone
And keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one day you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you (know that I love you)
There's no one above you (no one above you)
I said it the last time (hey, hey)
But this is the last time
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
Cuz I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
You're my number one

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Now who is she?
What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this
We fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back
Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
Cuz we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you (know that I love you)
There's no one above you (no one above you)
I said it the last time (hey, hey)
But this is the last time
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
Cuz I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
You're my number one

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
They say they shop on eBay – baby why is they frontin'?
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'
I keep you in Girl what is those on your toes?
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis
He got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit
And I don't wanna cheat but I don't be saying shit
I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin' wit?
But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you (know that I love you)
There's no one above you (no one above you)
I said it the last time (hey, hey)
But this is the last time
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
Cuz I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
You're my number one

[Verse 4: John Legend]
You're making it hard for me
You're messing up everything
You tell me I gotta leave
Say we over
You saw that she came over
Came in the Range Rover
Left with a hangover
Say we over
I promise I won't cheat
I promise I won't lie
I promise I'll act right
Say we over
You can't tell me
I can't have you
I can't have that
We ain't over

[Intro: Jay Z]
We in the time of our lives, baby
Turn the music up, primetime

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Uh, yeah, primetime, beat by Dion
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, 40-year-old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42, be better than 24s
I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23s, they can't fuck with the boy
As far as them 16s, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that six-deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
I started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for CÎROC to give Puff's stocks a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontainebleau
A case of Ace... make it two
Nigga, we rollin', beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do? Ooh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ooh, the night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
'Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn, Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib, so mine better be prime
Niggas gon' kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first-class flight
I'm tripping on it, socks on marble floors, I'm slipping on it
Champagne, I'm sipping on it, shit tastes different, don't it?
You know what? You right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home?" That's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that and doesn't laugh?
Hah...

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?




[Beanie Sigel]
(Yo) Who wanna fuck wit', the fat boy of the Roc?
(blldddttt) stick em, ha, another victim
Mac pullin' capers again
Fuck with that money paper then
Light as a rock, gonna light up the block
Don't believe in cases, goin all out
Paintin' faces, switch my picture, like tradin' places
For that money what?
Everybody hands up, or hands down money tucked
I flip the money trucks, money I don't give a fuck
Ay money, shut the fuck up
It's only a stickup
You don't stand a chance, give it quick up
You 'bout to turn into an ambulance pickup
Enough with the cocky stuff, fuck all that stocky stuff
Don't get smacked like a hockey puck
I ain't wit' that rocky stuff
I'm strapped got this gat (Blah blah blah blah)
What?

[Hook: Kurupt and Beanie 2x]
Gangsta gangsta, tell me how you do it
It seems so simple, like there was nothing to it
One more time run through it, everybody hands up
Alright hands down money tucked

[Beanie Sigel]
I'm on fire like a molotov cocktail
I'm high off them cocktails
Dangerous gone broke, my aim is no joke
Duct taped, roped, strangle your folks
Box cut across the throat (nope)
Bang the four 'till it's broke
Prey on niggas in a circlular pattern
Catch you playin' craps, car in reverse
I'm circlin' back
Man I stay up in them dice games, fuck a ice chain
A Ice ring, I'm tryin' to come up on some nice change
In case a nigga might swing, they gets a might thang
Pull out the right thang, show em it's a spike thang
Make you do the right thing, like a Spike Lee joint
Bang that pussy in his right knee joint
You get the sergeant and cap couldn't tell mack (freeze)
I'm like a rat dodgin' traps when it come to the cheeze
Backwards wrapped my trough
Won't hesitate to clap ya folks
I'm on tilt like a rapid (?)

[Hook 2x]

[Beanie Sigel]
Back now nigga, all black down nigga
Mack now, loaded up wit' black towns nigga
Frontline, clap down, background niggas
One nine clap crowns, and smack down niggas
Keep rope to hogtie you pork ass niggas
Stuffin' the boot to shoot hoops you sports ass nigga
Wouldn't shoot a game of pool
8-ball in the corner pocket, stop it
You niggas flippin' Guess jeans profit
Disrespectin' the scale, expectin' to sell
You got seeds in ya weed, disrespectin' the L
Don't got 20's on ya wheels disrespectin' the car
You burnin rubber and that squad, disrespectin the tar
You niggas wore ass backwards, vest and no gat
Same thing with your hustle, rustled and packed
The ball back on missions
Drop the east the mack more vicious
Back to snatch or crack off dishes

[Hook 2x]




[Spoken Intro: Kayne West]
You see I go by the name of Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
I'm with my home girl
Who need to hook me up with some of her home girls
Yeah, Janet Jackson
We back, baby

[Hook: Janet Jackson]
Don't matter what they say baby
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel about you
Cause you're so ooh

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
So many said we'd (never)
Never know love like this (but)
They never felt your kiss (felt your kiss)
And how good your touch could be (so)
Many a days I face the pressure to walk away (way)
From what the people say (people say)

[B-Section: Janet Jackson]
Baby(baby) these butterflies they never lie
Been thru so much pain before (and)
Baby (baby) - I had to try
Cause you're not like most guys

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
When you look in my eyes
I wish you could read my mind (and)
And know how I feel inside (feel inside)
And hear what they say about you
Just because they can't see (see)
You're more than enough for me (why)
Why can't they just let us be (can't they just let be)
And leave us alone

[B-Section: Janet Jackson]
Baby(baby) these butterflies they never lie
Been thru so much pain before (and)
Baby (baby) - I had to try
Cause you're not like most guys
And I ain't ashamed to say that you're my

[Hook: Janet Jackson]

Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
I won't let go my baby
And how I feel about you

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say I'm sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin' to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin' to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the street
He gon' want him some strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't need to be trippin'
This my first Rolex it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean I'm into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped for sure
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured

[Hook: Janet Jackson]
Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel about you
Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
I won't let go my baby
And how I feel about you
Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel about you
Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
I won't let go my baby
And how I feel about you

[Outro: Janet Jackson]
But y'all don't know a thing about my
My baby (baby) My baby (baby)
There's more to his love than what y'all see
And it don't describe what he is to me




[Verse: Kanye West]
So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's... mine!

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
Ahaha
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more!

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and then the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's—




[Verse 1: La Roux]
We can fight our desires
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotions
And what are feelings without emotions?

[Refrain: La Roux]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I’m going in and I’ma go hard
I mean what's the point if it ain't no scars
A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
That's real love, mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you, played you, spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you, turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things you’re not aware of
No one’s prepared for the scale of this, and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State you’re looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture, tailor-made
'Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh I'm breaking out the damn cage, aghh
Hannibal Lector, my A-merican Psycho
A iller version of Ike, yo
The Thriller version of Michael
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
A werewolf up in Paris, I'm livin' off your vitals
I mean, I’ll be your con man, I’ll be your damn liar
Let's start the interview, I’ll be your vampire
I gotta feel you, bite your neck to get familiar
And if you die, guess what, I fuckin' killed you

[Refrain: La Roux]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 3: La Roux]
Let’s go to war
To make peace
Let’s be cold
To create heat
I hope in darkness
We can see
And you’re not blinded by the light from me

[Refrain: La Roux]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand

Big blue, hot and sandy shoe
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
Play with me, see what the swammy do
My canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your family dues
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble goose
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots getting fucking loot
My top down, I’m flashing on em
I’m passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
The ratchets on ‘em, pay my dues, now it’s back to ballin'
Your raps are boring dead men, I dip the casket for em
I’m back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don’t call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin’
Stunt stormin, got these bitches soaked
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't

We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’mma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye,” I said “Yes, bitch”
"Damn I’m only asking you a question"
I met this MILF at the All-Star getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie I’m pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free,” I said, "wowzers"

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait, where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, 10 to 8, Interstate 95
Passenger, baddest bitch in the states
Half Spanish, half Trinidad, complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit

[Verse 4: Pusha-T]
My mind state, raise the crime rate
Break a whole brick down for old times sake
Push an avalanche, the alpine shake
The coupes, vanilla beam
Deceased as pound cake
In my condo bitches with tatties on
Walls full of mirrors, heaven for it at it long
My life the fast lane, getting my Andretti on
Blow it all, you can't take it when you dead and gone
You can't hide it, I smell the fear
I can't either, you smell a millionaire
All crack money, now rap money
Poor platinum niggas, fuckin' rap dummies
I rap mummies, that's kilograms
My brother's keeper like Nino's man
That’s G money, ghetto D money
1996, Master P money, gone
(Ah, hahaha)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I throw these Maybach keys
I throw these Maybach keys
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that pumpin' ain't free
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
I know that pussy, I don't need
I got that bump you gon' need
I throw these Maybach keys
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I get something drom my crib but nigga I won't bump the state
And fuck your stores and your employers
I'm good for grabs for all the reporters
None of them thump, all recorders
I ball with something with thump
I see they coming down my block and I'm struggling to get it done
I'll be calling out my prison sentence like a knock odd black D
All of y'all motherfuckers basic
I got that bump-bump places
Go stop, nothing for the kids
Ain't no more, nothing for the gangsters
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
I got that damn near snout
I got that damn near clout
I'm out those milestones now
We bout to bounce back now
I got that motherfucking wet
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West]
I can't wait to long, no, can't wait to long
So long,so long, so long
Can't wait for-for you
Can't let you go, I can't walk away
I keep breathin', I can't miss you
I don't know but I won't be without you
I can't wait to long, no, can't wait to long
So long,so long, so long
Can't wait for-for you
Can't let you go, I can't walk away
I keep breathin', I can't miss you
I don't know but I won't be without you
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ahaha




[Intro]
*Laughs* Yeah
This is straight fuckin violence music
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get fuckin' wild

[Verse 1]
Don't try me cause I might pop
Started from the bottom, now I'm on top
So it's no surprise my demise is on your knot
Park the Jaguar, so I don't get spotted
Cause I know the biddies in my city love to gossip
Try to talk to mama but she quotes the pastor
When you move cane like apples
You can't relate to those chapters
So I guess it doesn't matter when it's coming down
Bullets in the air, fold your circle round
They don't even care, they there to see you drown
They there to see you fall, they smile when you frown
So I guess I'm coming down like "nigga, don't try me"
Street hoes like Lindsay Lohan, don't high-five me
Zimmerman wanna box, I just do it like Nike
And a Nike hoodie with a box right beside me

[Outro]
Tell them stay up cause it can go down (7x)




[Hook: Dre]
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Mind right, money right
Red flag, red hat
I’m alright fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right I do it for the money
And if I don’t do nothing I’mma ball
I said if I don’t do nothing I’mma fuck you up
If you fuckin’ with me, who fuckin’ with me?
Fuck with me!!!
And where will I be, without my E
Yeah without my street, and that’s Apple & Eagle bitch
Haha and how can I see
When my E-Y-Es are C-L-O-S-E
Or I-C-U N I-T, D-R.﻿ C-A-R-T-E… R
Or, R-I-P haha
Yeah and it’s M-O-B ’til I D-I-E, flow D-O-As since my D-O-B
Mr. D-R-E talk to ‘em

[Hook: Dre]
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

[Verse 2 - Tity Boi]
Woke up this morning, feeling all horny
Picked up my pistol, fucked my opponent
The roof on dismissal, the feet are enormous
They on the same shit we switched up the toilets
I looked in the mirror and I said what’s happening?
The mirror said “you are, you conceited bastard!"
Well that’s true, the Coupe look like it came with the wheels
Because it got a paper tags still
And the passengers a pill away from being DOA
Down on her ass freak for the chips, Frito lay
And the waiter shorty move throw it thisa way
When the players hit the club nigga leave some way
Cause we as real as they soldiers in the field
Cause we fighting for something but we don’t know what it is
I’m trying to get higher than last months bills
Cause this months here, this one's clear
This one's brown, this one's beer
Man we got it lookin' like a bar in the VIP
The flow is contagious and deadly like Rabies
Had your girl in the suite swallowin' babies
But that is irrelevant it was all a pre-requisite
Nigga I’m ill, nigga I need medicine
Like Excedrin cause it’s this big
Broke my dishwasher and bought a new crib

[Hook: Dre]
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

I ain't the rapper that you want to talk noise to
It only makes me stronger
Only makes me stronger, stronger, stronger
I ain't the rapper that you want to talk noise to
It only makes me stronger
Only makes me stronger, stronger, stronger

[Verse 1]
Call the police, a paramedic and a nurse
Rap might be dead, but know what makes the matter worse?
(What?) I left my masters where the dada lurks
And Universal Records probably doesn't even have a hearse
I can't lose like I have a curse
I used to love her, but now I date a badder verse
It seems like acting got a fatter purse
I'm almighty with mix tapes, you back to church
My homeboy, was always a man of turf
Cause he be interred, like the words on a mechanic shirt
I think I need to send a fan alert
Nonsense, sure to send a humble ?
I'm so cool, I jump in a pool
And everything that's in it ain't blue turn blue
Man I'm so cool, I walk into school
And numbers on the ruler tell me that I rule
Who, can make a mix tape skin
Have goosebumps if a mix tape had skin
I'm, Lennox Lewis with the left, right, left
I'm knocking out a mix tape's wind
I say whatever I want to say like Kanye
I'm calling, telling have a nice day
If hip hop is dead then I say
That I escaped Death Row like I'm Dre
Cause you're pale and I'm looking colourful
Don't lie about my mix tapes, I know you love em fool..
I know you love em fool
I had to drop part 2, that means another 2
She told me Ridin' Dirty was a hard tune
And then told me to call her at tomorrow noon
One night with me is really your doom
I'll be sticking something in it like a harpoon
18th of September on your calendar
Chamillionaire gets badderer and badderer
Chamillionaire badder than the average huh
I'm a, I'm a raw like an animal
Haha, if a man is mechanical
I'll come through and do what a real man would do
And you'll change your whole thing
Like Claire Reid sleeping in bed with Hannibal the Cannibal

[Intro]
Yeah, check check, testing
It's clear out there, yeah
It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic ‘cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will

[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 2]
This ain't to glorify, just painting a street picture
There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers
Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, and
It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin' and flaggin'
Got the West Coast laughin'
Now Esco's askin', "What happened?"
My homegirl from upper Manhattan; she remembers the quarters that's Latin, a lot of rat-a-tat-tattin'

[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

[Verse 3]
The son of the audio cassette era, TEC wearer
Bullets and baguettes, Benz Bose Speaker Terror
Deman I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red
Like that horse standing on it's hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder
Not Ned the Wino like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart, ‘cause y'all will run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about Ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake getter, the ex-wig splitter to touch you, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game
We can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas

[Bridge: Nas + (Tre Williams)]
[And I] Right about now [And I] (They don't really know)
[And I] (They don't really see)
I don't even deal with all that garbage
(No, no, no) We getting real right, you know?
[And I] (Though I walk through the valley)
That is Tre Williams, ladies and gentlemen
[And I] (They should fear no) [And I] (no, no-oh)
Focus on good things, man, good times, heh-heh, alright

[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light!

Oh let it be, let it be, yeah
Let it be, let it be




[Intro: Grav]
Like this
From the realm of the dunzillas
From Chi town to uptown
My man Rashaun, Kanye, Seldom C, Sway
Meet Grav
And spark on this like 4th day 'Raq

[Verse 1: Grav]
Flow's wicked like eurocentrics, magically makin' men emerge
Spiritual urge, that leave from their body to surge to witness my verbs
Leave holes in chest cavities like vaginas black
Finger poppin' souls with facts
Mishaps and missteps, repulsive acts nonstop
We load the clip to keep my mind skills on cock
Against corrupted MCs, splittin' their skulls with one swift motion
Cosmic destruction cause I get high from Merlin's potion

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin' bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived, he died
For his image, now let's start the scrimmage
In the first quarter, I sacked 25 MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with 75 seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my life's breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensation'll shine through your mind
Take it line for line

[Chorus: Grav + Kanye West]
Play across the board to rob these niggas blind
When we're takin' 'em line for line
Yo let's react with our mind, kill the black-on-black crime
I'll be takin' it line for line

[Verse 3: Seldom C]
Yo what you got, nigga?
I got a fix for your binge
Laced dope that soaks nerves numb
Slung in slums to a steady stream of clientele
Eager tongues fold under pressure, the parallel
Doubt disarrays the strongest efforts like a spell
The spell will lift, the truth be even more vague
Infectious on phonograph, a verbal plaque plague
That preys on focused ears, I steer the culture in a new direction
Disarm your psyche before you can reach your Smith & Wesson

[Verse 4: Sway]
I write like a cartel
Melody mercenaries that fits the art well
A secret order of chosen artists summoned from global markets
Plottin' precise assaults on sub-terrainian targets
Citizens seek refuge from bombshed that drops constant
Poetically potent content executed on some calm shit
Yo I heard they said [?] ghettobred, thorough head
That an MC that can't rhyme is better off than said
Best music off rhymes like [?] holdin' 8ths
From a malicious mouth face that makes radioactive space
The science we seek, world supremacy over beats
A league of crowd catalysts unleashed on the streets

[Chorus: Seldom C + Sway]
Why you reachin' for your heat? My shit's concealed in the mind
When I'm takin' 'em line for line
Anonymous masterminds shiftin' a paradigm
When I'm takin' 'em line for line

[Verse 5: Rashaun]
From the cotton fields runaway slaves misbehavin'
My cravings remain eclectic, stay pathetic
Prognosis, verbal dope feign who overdoses
Regain focus, but hold, the pale horse approaches
Roaches, collect the Ls up, my head said it
Plus up the magnetic, I keep shit connected
When crews get beheaded, slave ring the antiseptic
My man Sway erect shit lace it then I bless it
Ayo, uptown heads gravitate toward Saturn
Moon spin me while Seldom C's gone with the wind
On the third day let my mental ascend
Where platinum dicks make your portals do tricks
Dimensional slits trip through space and time
While you black cats remain blind I become sunshine

[Verse 6: Grav]
Risen from tombs
To wreak stress havoc and doom
On flesh and bones of niggas who think microphones
Are restitutes for gods controllin'  the weather
Verbal showers and razor blades rain down to sever
Body parts to expose their inner skin linin'
Death to weak foes from my in depth rhymin'
My timin' is exact and quick to stain brains
From gusts to strong winds and ill hurricanes
Somethin' wicked this way comes
Hey yo in the side of the norm
Niggas'll run take cover from the storm
I cause, when provoked and forced to get loose
With the same lightnin' bolts that I stole from Zeus
It's a holocaust with terror that most niggas fear
Grizzly type style that's rather hard to bear
Forces driven by ancient spirits
That's barefoot with naps, goatees and Chuck spears
Yo, check, as shadow emits from headstones to headphones
Bust eardrums, leave dead tones
In hemispheres of brains used to comprehend
How me and my niggas turned gods to mortal men

[Outro: Rashaun, Grav & Kanye West]
In apocalyptic times I let my third eye shine
When I'm takin' 'em line for line
I take five niggas' souls and convert 'em into mine
Now we takin' 'em line for line
Take 'em now, take 'em now, take 'em now
Take 'em to the side
Side for side

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up."
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Outro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)




[Intro - Big Sean]
Ay, Big!
They say they want something real
Thats what I’mma give em
And if I keep it real how could they not feel it

Hey yeah
Can you say GOOD music?
Can you say GOOD music?

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a bad ass chick
Everybody wanna grab her
Tryna climb on that looking for a ladder
Niggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it
Everybody want it
Ain't too many had it
Beauty and brains, went to all the classes
Graduated too even went and got a masters
Bad ass chick probably could have been an actress
So what she do?
She want to be an actress
Moved to Manhatton, shit got real
Took acting classes with Denzel
Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills

Commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill
Yeah, plus she had a baby boy
And the nigga she was with she couldn’t love more
Still want more, shit, she on a roll
Move to Hollywood, she could probably get a role
And she did, but realised the nigga wasn’t shit
Addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant
With another boy
Honestly thought abort but still had the boy
Lets name him Sean
Honestly probably after Connery
One of her favourite actors but acting ain't promising
Ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you
And thats why I’m giving you

[Hook]
(Whatever you want)
This whatever you want
(Before)
Just tell me
(Whatever you want)
You deserve whatever you want
(Before)
I won’t stop till you get whatever you want
(All the lights)
All the lights
(The love, dreams you blew away
For your baby boy
Hold on, I'm on my way
(whatever you want)




[Keyshia Cole]
Got me doing the things that I do, do
Ain't nobody treat me like you do, you
Keep me held down, when no one else is around
You show me love

[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
S-s-s-s so you say, used to diss me every day
Now she happy, Lil Scrappy, see me, she like, "OK-K"
Naw bitch naw, down with your drawers
You gon' need some Tylenol
For my head Tag Team said
"Take it to the house", naw, we gon' take it to the bed
And kick you out, put you out for the times you wasn't puttin' out
Take off your shoe, you finna put your foot in your mouth
I got my new ho, so what the fuck I'mma need you fo'?
Matter of fact I'mma need you to go
Hop back in your broke Yugo
And that go double for these bitch ass niggas
These snitch ass niggas, you just can't get rich ass niggas
Rhymemode's my crew
Sunday through Monday I'm out on the block
With of bundle of money like Russell who touchin' you
Wasn't you, nothin', who bustin' you lames?
So Pusha Man finna go out and get money

[Hook: Kanye West (w/ Bump J)]
Game gettin' unusual man
Go to war like Bush for change
You don't know, then you's a lame
(Man, I'm the pusha man)
Man, I'm the pusha man
(Man, I'm the pusha man)
You don't know, then you's a lame
Man, I'm the pusha man

[Verse 2: Bump J]
Get the O's and bag 'em up
Get the shit off fast as fuck
I give you a pack, you don't wanna get clapped
You better have my dust
Ask the hoes 'bout my pimp game
Spit game insane
Get brain while a nigga switch lane
Mom was short when the rent came
So her youngest boy had no choice but to go out and flip 'caine
Now I'm caught up in the mix man
I let a clip bang
Runnin' 'round lookin' for that big [stain?]
Hundred niggas gonna follow and the models
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense, lame
Since the birth been hustlin'
I don't hurt for nothin'
Get rid of bricks like I work construction
If I ever kick off, front line with the iron, I'm the first one bustin'
If you ever run up I'mma hurt you cousin
Swisher Sweet full of that purple stuff then
Bump is on and it hurts you doesn't it?
Chump
I got my...

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
How can you say Kan is so pompous?
You ain't been to his concerts?
You just talking that nonsense
He in the same league Nas is
Or Jay is
My favorite
A lot of people say that's where 'Ye is
Though a freshman still the West man
One of the best, man, like Taye Diggs
And I was oh so patient
While niggas straight disrespectin' him
So I did what they ain't expect from him
Dropped The Dropout and blazed 'em
And ain't nobody feel my pain
Until the hits that I came with
I'm Kanye not Kayne
But to you, I'm Rick James bitch

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 4: Bump J]
And they said I couldn't take it, said I wouldn't make it
Hate it that I'm this far
Hate to see Bump in that big car
But I flix hard when I spit bars
You gots to listen I come from the gutter
Do you know what it took to get these rocks to glisten?
On the block with biscuits I copped and pitched it
Back then I ain't have a pot to piss in
And to all my women that's caught up in the struggle
That gotta strip just to pay tuition
Baby daddy trippin', I feel your pain
If you don't know then you's a lame
I give you food for brain
And I'mma do my thang just like I'm supposed to
I had to quit the game, I used to flip the 'caine
Now I'm spittin' flames on these Pro Tools
Young bloods from my niggas in the old school
I know exactly what y'all gotta go through
Keep pushin' it's gonna go through
I'm yo proof

[Hook x2: Kanye West]




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse: Common]
Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale - Horse"
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it -

[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
"Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again"




[Intro]
Til the Casket Drops!
Third time's the charm right? Hahaha! Come on

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I'm kinda like a big deal, it's unbelievable
You see my warning gives you big chills
The flow running on BIG's heels
My life after death, BIG ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's the charm, baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessing to blow a hundred thou in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha-ha, we're ballin', drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin', Re-Up is the gang and I'm all in
To the powder and the flame I have fallen
Get money, blow money is my calling
Yeah, watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push

[Hook: Pusha T]
They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ayo, I'm sitting on top of the, it's more than a feeling, ain't it?
I be killing, damn it, I'm illin', I'm illin', ay-ay-ay-ay
Meet Mr. Popular, go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be
Spitting fire on the PJ in my PJs
Fire Marshall said I took it to the max like TJ
Y'all ain't peep, I said Marshall's, replay
I guess I'm like the black Marshall meets Jay
Meet 'Ye, alligator souffle, got it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in special ed
You know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
"What happened, Tisha, your boyfriend come fast?"
Turn around, give me pound like we folks
"Hell no, I went raw-dog, three strokes!"

[Hook: Pusha T]
They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

[Verse 3: Malice]
Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I'm B. Hop in the ring, niggas, you cash in, it's like
Stopping a train, nigga think he's stopping my reign
Talk slick while dropping my name?
I'm putting y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits, I X out the middleman
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
The C-4S with the rims protruding
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me looking to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you sow

[Hook: Pusha T]
They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
The Cool
Turn me up, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
He came back, in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read, "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Verse 2]
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped, six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box, wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Verse 3]
He begged for some change to get him on the train
"Damn, that nigga stank" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look, wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thang, first he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block, it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, "You're scared, ain't ya?"
He said, "Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangsta"
And...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Outro]
Yeah, uhh
Cool!

[Chorus]
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Man I feel like I'm on top of the world
Never heard him, I convert 'em, put my lovin' in 'em
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Baby I can take you from your girl

[Verse 1]
I was with my muse, Arizona
Sippin' on Arizona iced teas, homie
We havin' dinner at the MOMA
Oh this young pretty fly thing starin' at me
She kissin' girls cause she wanna
Deep down in her soul, man she fishin' for D
She send emojis to my phone
Now we in the black cab, turnt and gettin' trippy
I like all of her friends, they're some nice girls
She a runway tall model, pretty white girl
I never discriminate, just dated three black girls
That's my private life so you don't know that, girl
Indian, Russian, now I'm back in Milano
Where they feed me Italian cause I don't eat no McDonalds
All these girls be frontin', tryna be in disguise
On that hush, hush, hush, she tellin' you lies
Girl!

[Chorus]
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Man I feel like I'm on top of the world
Never heard him, I convert 'em, put my lovin' in 'em
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Baby I can take you from your girl

[Interlude]
Girl 1: Hello?
Girl 2: Oh my God, I feel so bad
Girl 1: Hello?
Girl 2: We were, we were dancing and we started to kiss
Girl 1: Where are you?
Girl 2: I'm at his house now.. I.. I.. need you
Girl 1: Which house? Did you with him?
Girl 2: Oh my God, we were making love and, please don't tell Kaitlyn, just
Girl 1: I'm with everyone now
Girl 2: Just, just come now cause I need to get out of her, I'm really
Girl 1: I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 2]
All these girls be frontin', tryna be in disguise
She said she's testin' the waters and how she don't do guys
Until last night, I was provin' her wrong
Had my tongue in her thighs, and nearly makin' her cry
And she told me a sad story how her life is tough
She never go this far, but I was callin' her bluff
She was stuck and thinkin' about the girl that she loves
All the guilty pleasures, man, this shit addin' up
Her phone vibratin', two missed calls from her lover
Textin', "Where you at girl?"
I ain't gon' lie, we was deep between the covers
I was sayin', "Throw it back, girl"
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, was my lover
It's a shame last night she was with the LVRS
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, was my lover
I don't think she's comin' back, girl

[Chorus]
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Man I feel like I'm on top of the world
Never heard him, I convert 'em, put my lovin' in 'em
She told me that she only do girls
But since she met a player like me
Baby I can take you from your girl




[Intro]
Maybe they seen me on the videos
Or they heard me on the radio

[Chorus]
Tip tried to tell me but damn I wouldn’t listen
Ye' tried to tell me but man I wouldn’t listen
Damn I should have listened
What would you do if it was you in my position?
Maybe they seen me on the videos
And they put me in the damage zone
Damn I should have listened
So for now I'm just laying low
Damn I should have listened

[Verse 1]
Cons, what makes you think you are any better than the rest?
If your homies wouldn't flip on you for a check
They try to stick you up for that chain around your neck
Even if they did man there is no disrespect
It's the rules of engagement, you just got engaged
Tryin to rewrite history before they turn the page
But that’s when they turn and aim
Shit you better learn the game
I mean what you thought would happen once you finally got ya stacks up
The same boy who would tell them fools to back up
Is mad as hell when he sees you hold your plaques up
To get them dranks in him (now he wanna act up)
To tell the friend who tell the friend to tell the friend
And since there's strength in numbers, jealousy begins
And it doesn’t matter if it’s true or it's not
These are the Consequences when they say that you’re hot

[Chorus]
Tip tried to tell me but damn I wouldn’t listen
Ye' tried to tell me but man I wouldn’t listen
Damn I should have listened
What would you do if it was you in my position?
Maybe they seen me on the videos
And they put me in the damage zone
Damn I should have listened
So for now I'm just laying low
Damn I should have listened

[Verse 2]
Same old movie being re-enacted
They see me in that Benz coupe now they wanna jack 'em
But before they would have backed em
Now they screamin let me at em
Maybe they seen me on the videos
Or they heard me on the radio
And now they coming at me crazy yo
That’s why I gotta tuck the 80 yo
But how you gonna front on baby bro
Who's trying to go even though you told him take it slow
I guess you seem convinced
That they would put a suit on me like g's to gents
But I'm like a tea-bag when you put me in the corner
I just get stronger when my name's in hot water
So whether is true or not
These are the consequences when they say that you're hot

[Chorus]
Tip tried to tell me but damn I wouldn’t listen
Ye' tried to tell me but man I wouldn’t listen
Damn I should have listened
What would you do if it was you in my position?
Maybe they seen me on the videos
And they put me in the damage zone
Damn I should have listened
So for now I'm just laying low
Damn I should have listened

[Outro]
Everybody told me told me told me told me baby baby
Damn I should have listened
Everybody told me baby everybody told me told me
Damn I should have listened




[Intro: Marcus Garvey]
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess what, baby? I feel free (Scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Created from no-no-no
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
You should quit your job to this
Hold up, let 'em jog from this
Got blunts or what, one stun of lumps
Don't slow the lumps
Got grrrrr

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This like a mix of some Ja Rule shit
And some King Fool shit
Under rude, city news shit
This is a fool's shit
I'm on some ooze shit
I'm on some wildin' out in the news shit
I'm on some Doctor Blues and
Psycho, kind of lose it
Don't con-confuse it
Leo called me artist and said, "Don't lose the music"
I got no reclusion
I've been known to cruise it
We stuck with a some motherfuckers you don't know like a cruise ship
Had a son, news shit
Banging on that new shit
Popstar movement
And he going foolish
Many going stupid
Man ain't got the movement
In the cut, I'm foolin'
Sorry, couldn't use it, uh

[Outro: Kanye West]
Guess not, bum-bum-bum, yeah, anymore
Guess what, babe? I feel free




[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet"
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

[Chorus: Kanye West & Junie Morrison]
Please, no more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

[Outro: Junie Morrison]
Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
Swish

[Chorus 2x - Big V]
These walls are closin' in
How long am I supposed to grin?
I've lost my will to win
Forgive my sin

[Scales]
As darkness approaches, and I'm fumblin' through the blunt roaches
Its lookin' hopeless, totally unfocused, stumblin' onto the front porch
Posted with my closest associates, we were so broke
Though a couple of us had sold dope, still humble enough to be po' folk
We comin' up to be grown folk, ain't dumb enough to be slow poke
Know the hours of death they grow close, so we give our lives to the utmost
Plus, here's a extra point, visualize the goal post
No, we not eatin' duck roast, but we live our lives to the utmost
Cause those pressure points are the corners that we cut close
Turn most civilized yeagas to cutthroats
And it's these men they send upstate by the truckloads
And herd 'em in to the Pen' like buffalos, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]

[Big V]
The game was sold, not told to me
Heartache won't let go of me
Games say that I'll live and lie
But I'll try

[Big V]
Every which-a-way tell you the angles I done tossed and turned
And hit and missed, pissed cause of that didn't amount to this
Gettin' it ain't got a damn thing to do with keepin' shit
Workin' damn hard to get it, plans of not partin' with it
Life got a way of showin' you shit you can't bear to see
Tough keepin' float, settin' sail through a sea of Gs
Somethin' should happen on this night I lay me down to sleep
Wasn't happy with my friend, pray the lord my soul to keep

[Chorus]

[Scales]
I'm 'bout 3000 miles from Graceland, 'bout a county from Macon
But you would think I'm arm reach from Satan
I got a strange way of tellin' the truth
Most felons do stuff between hearin' your story and tellin' it too
Stuck between numb and feelin' it
I'm right between calm and militant, on the search for deliverance
I'm three days from beatin' my case at the arraignment
This shit's basic, get to jail, get the statement

[R. Prophet]
Born with the heart of a soldier
Right now I'm stuck behind bars but daddy told ya
I chose to march with Martin carryin' posters
They lock me down, but they usually hang us folks up
It's so tough, white man tryin' to control us
And mold us, assimilate our cultures, they doped us
Hell naw, I'm stayin' focused, I won't corrupt with evil
I'm forever fightin' for my people, for equal
(Fight for your rights)

[Chorus]

"Ladies and gentlemen, I have some very sad news for all of you
Could you lower those signs please?
Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight.."




[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I’m worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give ’em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don’t know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I’m here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I’m way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we’re back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed




[Intro: Max B & French Montana]
It's your boy Max Biggavel
We wavy, wavy baby, on the wave, oww!
Why I always do that?
'Cause I had this over my head
So I said I figure you know
If I gotta go to trial, probably just go trial
At least I know a nigga out there holding it down, you know what I'm saying?
We was a part of something together my nigga
You killin' them, number one
Like he real wavey right now
[?] new records
It's no secret
You get the coke wave listenin' to him (Yeah)
Keep the jams on the radio
Macaroni & Cheese
I'm telling them
I already know how it's gonna go down
You feel me?
Nothin'
No evil [?] shall prosper (Woo!)
Who God blessed, no man cursed
And they say
Haan!

Getting shot up, then he got up
Came back then he lit the spot up
Homie hit the chart up
Moroccan boy, you sloppy boy
3 chains on, I be Rocky boy
Packs out the lobby boy
Nigga you can read on, East Tremont
Franks, got my feet on
With money I can lean on
Canary chain cold but still keep the heat on
Your bitch with the raccoon vest, Peter Pete on
Catch me at the game, hard wood where my feet on
Lookin for an actress on my wood I could skeet on
Mansion on the other hand, live from the mother land
2 straps on, east side, we ain't rumbling

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Alfred Hitchcock, two fear fist fight
Caught a nigga slippin for his chain and his wrist watch
Murder was the case that they gave me,
I can’t believe my boo bout to have my baby
Fuck, you outta luck, Mercedes truck
Pull up, distance, shoot better than Miller
Ducking from the narcs, Elsmere Crotona park
Out of control, now a nigga gon' control the market
Shoot outs and move out, ask the brick layers
Now I'm floor seats, talkin' to the bench players
Tell Mike Bibby, it’s my city
Leave the game, hit green house, me and Diddy

[Chorus 2: French Montana]
Murder
Cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Verse 1: Common]
I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Verse 2: Common]
He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Interlude: Common]
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged..you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us... black maybe

Black maybe...

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...




[Intro]
Ah, where my real people at?
Yeah, ah, let me see my real people with their hands in the air
Wherever you from, real people, let's do it, baby

[Verse 1]
Yo, real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green, our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls, raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother?
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain, wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep 'em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Chorus]
Real people in the house, real people, real people check it out
Real people know what I'm talking about, it's real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat Blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these brothas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home?
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
Yo, it's real people

[Chorus]
Uh, real people in the house, real people know what I'm talking about
It's real people, real people in the house, it's real people, it's real people, uh




[Intro]
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem

[Verse 1]
Been through more than a lil' bit
Been through more than a lil' bit
But I ain't callin' no names out
No, no free promotion
Naw, naw I ain't late, I don't do due dates
No sneak diss, no sneak shit
That's just how I was raised
Had to get it out the soil
I been down, I been loyal
When you really hold it down
Niggas ain't even really down for ya
Oh no, what a shame
10 years in the game
Niggas like "You ain't hot? You ain't pop yet?
What's up wit' you and Ye?"

[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]
(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete
(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet
(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything

[Refrain]
It be the ones who say they ride for you
It be the ones, the ones you love, them too
It be the ones who swear they real, not true
It be them ones, It be them ones
Don't get caught up
It be the ones, the ones you closest to
It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too
It be the ones, the ones you look up to
It be the ones
Don't get caught up, young girl

[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]
(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete
(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet
(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything

[Verse 2]
Been through more than a lil' bit
Been through more than a lil' bit
But I ain't callin' no names out
No, no free promotions
If it ain't 'bout blessings
I can't even address it
I just bought my third house
No album out and I got 'em asking
'What do she do?' I do everything
I move everything
Put that on my wedding ring
Put that on my baby name
All these fake smiles
These chicks must just came from a dentist
I can tell it ain't genuine
I get so offended

[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]
(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete
(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet
(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything

[Refrain]
It be the ones who say they ride for you
It be the ones, the ones you love, them too
It be the ones who swear they real, not true
It be them ones, It be them ones
Don't get caught up

It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too
It be the ones, the ones you look up to
It be the ones
It be the ones who say they ride for you
It be the ones, the ones you love, them too
It be the ones who swear they real, not true
It be them ones, It be them ones
Don't get caught up
It be the ones, the ones you closest to
It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too
It be the ones, the ones you look up to
It be the ones
Don't get caught up, young girl

A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem
A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem
Don't get caught up, young girl

[Intro]
Stadium status

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Hook]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, "New Jack City"—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'mma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"
Translate, español: "No way, José"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Hook]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

[Outro]
Toomp killed this shit




[Verse 1]
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck being a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, 'cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin' in the way of that is dyin'
I bust nine—how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me

[Scarface]
One wrong move, and I'ma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then (Explosion)
Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?
You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?

[Hook]
I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta, right?

[Verse 2]
I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, "Fuck this dude"
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone, "Ay", I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the run
And I'm fo'sho I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'mma die standin up cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy

[Hook]

Right?




[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 1]
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Man I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, nigga you ain't up on this
That's why I'm iced out, medallion heavy on the wrist
My niggas servin' the checks like the first and fifth-teenth
So insecurr, cut that coke 'til it's so unpure
We all need furs by December the third
Cause you heard, Chicago winters is extra burr
Bricks, nicks, nigga so herb
Hustlin' to the whole world, never sober
Seats in the Rover, soft as sofurrs
Ballin so hurr 'till I need a chauffeur

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 2]
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy shorty a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

[Verse 3]
It may seems we living the nigga's American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
As any means to get that green
Cause society done turned us all into fiends
For the road to riches and diamond rings
And what about the teens moms hearts that broke?
Niggas got killed over Starter coats
But I can feel why the shorties be mad as shit
Without the Jordans, he feelin' inadequate
He be feelin' so insecure
Dawg, why that nigga got it? Man life unfair
He be feelin' like fuck the world and furthermore
Feelin' like it's worth
Killin' a person for
But when that pain's gone, it just hurts some more
It seems the sun never shine, that we searchin' for

[Chorus]
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know
You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

Remember back in ’92, niggas used to catch wreck, shit
Remember that track I tracked for you bout three months ago?
Uh 0uh, that’s the one, now cut my check, bitch
And I ain't feeling that Lexus - more that CLK
See me like "Damn! A CL, K?”
Yeah that’s how we eating and, keep us looking peace and then
I ain't know he rap as good as he do beats, and then

[Hook]
I go to Jacob with 25 thou
You go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single damn nigga, wow
H to the Izzo did three-thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin' y'all from Chi-town

[Verse Three]
Now, niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
You know the rules, five up close, one gon' leave ya
You don't know about Kanye? Son gon' teach you
What's the first thing that popped in ya mind
While I was popping this rhyme?
You don't picture popping a nine?
See you paralyzed from the top of the spine...

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’ma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm the one, baby, yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby, you on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - yeaaaalm!

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’ma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I told Detroit I'mma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive
I'm on HBO with my entourage, I'm 5'9'' fuckin' 9 to 5
I need a hundred million no compromise, I'm a double X-L nigga
Magazine and condom size, see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate, everyday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud, I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day
I did it

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’ma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit sharing
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all, I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag
Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace, it was really kind
Of awesome, it's possible, goddamn right
Yeah I've been honest the whole time
Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace, it was really kind
Of awesome, it's possible, goddamn right
Yeah I've been honest the whole time




[Verse: Frank Ocean]
The rings all ringed out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out




[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed




[Intro: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more to stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shining star

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinking 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch
When we're laying right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinking understanding
Don't let a feeling change it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone
Thinking 'bout what I'm gon' do
I hope that I see it through, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

[Outro: Teyana Taylor & Randy Cain]
And are you gonna love me? yeah
And are you gonna hold me? And squeeze me
Are you gonna love? And squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
Are you gonna hold me?
And squeeze me, squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
You're gonna wanna hold me
And squeeze me, and squeeze me




[Kanye West]
It’s like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it’s from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn’t reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyoncé up to give the award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya

[Mos Def]
No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on




[Verse 1]
Here's a story bout a nigga named Hate
Who lived next door to this cat named Great
See Great did everything Great that he put his mind to
But Hate had a mind-state he was confined to
Had a chick named Misery, the neighborhood ho
And the company she kept, you know how that go?
Me, I stayed on Prosperity Street and Success Lane
Was taught comin up in the streets to respect game
This nigga Jealousy was always telling me how Envy dont like me
Envy wanna fight me. See Envy was a shiesty type a nigga
Who showed his discontent politely
Snake in the grass assnigga that'd cross you soon as he get the chance
Type a nigga that'd throw salt on your plans
Teamed up with Hate, tried to sh\it on Great
Cuz when you make it to the top
This is what youll await
With that said

[Chorus]
You see, If you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'll always be somebody that'd shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, thats the way it is
Hater nigga marry hater bitches and have hater kids
And they be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...

[Verse 2]
I studied the secret, know the laws of attraction
Knew what the consequences were for my actions
I laid the foundation but they acting
Like I didn't do nothing on my own to make this happen
Like, nigga was writing but I was rapping (damn)
But everybody took the credit when it happened (why?)
And I'm almost dead, I can feel it though
But niggas catch feelings when they feeling they ain't near you though
And there you go, your true colors show
He say she say, it wasn't really nothing though
I'm still here, still down, still around
Lets do lunch this week cause next week I'm out of town (damn dawg)
Now they telling my mama he act different (why?)
Just cause my black berry went to my assistant (okay)
But shit is wicked on these mean streets
Some of my friends sleep and y'all trying to win but then again

[Chorus]
If you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'll always be somebody that'd shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, thats the way it is
Hater nigga marry hater bitches and have hater kids
And they be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...

[Verse 3]
You was on the outside looking in
But now you're on the inside looking out
And as you think back to the things you did
When you was trying to get on, no one helped you out

Now when you ride by the haters (look at the six)
And when you wave to the ladies (look at his wrist)
Now everybody need a favor (listen to this)
My definition of a hater, that's what this is

[Chorus]
If you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'll always be somebody that'd shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, thats the way it is
Hater nigga marry hater bitches and have hater kids
And they be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...
It's gon' be one big hater family...

[Intro: Lenny Kravitz]
When was the last time we got to be 100% real, ya'll?
I don't want ya'll holding back nothing!

[John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
We made a lot of magic
It’s the only way we know
Let’s trip the night fantastic
Light it up, tell me more, explore
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why’d we ball so hard?

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Bridge: John Legend]
We’ve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin’ fast, I’m never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Semi in the truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like I’m Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I don’t know about y’all, but I feel good tonight
There’s something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?

[Lenny Kravitz]
This is our song – our song for the future

[Intro]
"Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV!
Thanks for coming out tonightYou could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me, I appreciate that, ah"

[Verse 1]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Outro]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A

[I. "Murder"]

[Intro: Jay Z]
Uh, bloody murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder" again

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Uh, this is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I’m out here fighting for you, don’t increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I’m from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, "Damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder"
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder" again
"Murder" again

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain’t got enough room for all the tombs
It’s a war going on outside we ain’t safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I’m out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it’s all black, uh, I love us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder"
The paper read: "Murder, black-on-black murder" again
"Black-on-black murder" again
"Black-on-black murder" again

[II. "Excellence"]

[Interlude: Jay Z]
It’s a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Huh, yeah, uh

[Verse 5: Jay Z]
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I’m present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I “shh-shh”
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go, uh
What’s up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain’t enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I’m all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Yeah, it’s all messed up when it’s nowhere to go
So we won’t take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G’s, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG’s
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What’s the life expectancy for black guys?
The system’s working effectively, that’s why
I’ll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause ain’t nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain’t nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let’s savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours

For all the fame, and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
And take my mind, out of this jail
And my heart, out of this hell
There are no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, What does it feel like
I ask you tonight, What does it feel like
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
I just wanna be a real boy
The funny thing is
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm looking out there, tryna find something
I looked on the TV, and I see me, and see nothing
So what does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Wait a second, where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you to say, "Can you sign an autograph?"
For everybody that sees you crying, say "you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!?"
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, Real life
Real life, Real life

Nigga don't miss, better not miss
Better not miss... Better not miss

We gon' say that people don't like you
We gon' try to make the whole world hate you...
Don't tell, don't never say what everybody else is thinking...
Nigga, nigga don't miss...
Walk perfectly, in this town...

And I feel down again, when I'm down again...
And I'm down again...

Can you imagine how many times they told me
That I would never work in this town again?
In this town again...
And I felt down again, and I felt down again...
And I felt down again...(Do you get it?)
Can you imagine how many times they told me
I'd never work in this town again
But now, 2 nights at the Hollywood Bowl, sold out!
AYE, Don't let 'em bring you down, don't let 'em bring you down, down...
It's more ways than they way to do it
And I'm here to prove it...
I'm here to prove it, I'm here to prove it...
I'm here to prove it...
Nigga don't miss, nigga don't miss
Walk like this, do it like this
Don't get nobody pissed
Walk like this, or we gon' beat you, (aye, aye, aye, aye...)
And they told me, told me...
For 6 years that ain't nobody love me
And they told me, they told me...
You better not show your face in public boy
They told me
Better stand still Emmett Till, better stand still Emmett Till
They told me, they told me, they told me...
(they told me, they told me, they told me, they told me...)
Like Pinocchio, they must have lied
Cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
Oh, they must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, lied...

[Hook: John Mayer]
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, "Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

[Hook: John Mayer]
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be"
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

[Hook: John Mayer & Kanye West]
Bittersweet (I fucked up and I know it, G)
You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says

[Part 1: Kollegah]
Ich liebe meine Hood
Komm' vom Urlaub aus Jamaika heim und Leute salutier'n in meiner Hood, killa
Du fährst im Volkswagen, Kid
Ich bin colttragender Pimp mit Hoes in goldfarbenden Strings
Ich bin viel zu bescheiden
Kuck' uns an, wir sind deutsche Rapper, aber trotzdem stilvoll gekleidet
Nigga, sei leise, du bist eine Schande für Rap, ich bin Boss an dem Mic
Sieh dir bitte meine Versace-Watch an und sag, du kannst dir nie sowas leisten
Ich bin Zuhälterrapper wie Juelz Santana
Hab' ich nichts zu tun, mach' ich paar Groupies im Benz klar
Und these mo'fucking hoes and bitches
Sprechen von Hochgenüssen, wenn sie meinen Hoden küssen
Ich stepp' in der Nacht in dein Viertel und töte dich mit Pistolenschüssen

[Hook]

[Part 2: Sunny]
Kid, das ist die Erfassung, du siehst die Bling-Kette
Guck wie ich mit Air Force über dein Gesicht steppe
Du siehst Kollegah im Benz, wie edel er glänzt
Er rollt damit über dein Schädel, my man
Es gibt kein Ausweg und es gibt kein Rausreden
Rausgehen, auf die Fresse kriegen, nie wieder aufstehen
This is how you do it, ich weiß du findest uns cool
Und pumpst unsere Track bei deinen Homes von der Grundschule
Ihr seht mich und glaubt mir nicht das ich rap
Ich bin zu schön zum rappen, es ist schön so perfekt zu sein
Einfach Raps zu schreiben
Lass die Pumpgun [?], mit der Gun hier am Drücker
Das ist Game Over, Kid, das ist Take Over

[Hook]

[Part 3: Migo]
Mach mich einmal an, ich komm mit tausend Klickbrüdern
Du wirst gehauen wie damals in der Pause Mitschüler
Sorry, du kannst mit diesem Team nicht mithalten
Und deine Frau ist nur für dieses Team ne Fickspalte
Junge, kannst es machen wie's gefällt
Ich brauch keine Fans, nur ne Karre und 'n Pelz
Ich rap nicht aus Spaß, ich rap für Bares
Wenn ich deine Bitch fick kitzelt meine Kette ihren Arsch
Yo, Ich bin sowas wie Gott für dich
Ich mache Rap, scheiß auf Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop ist für'n Strich
Deine Frau ist lecker und ich poppe die Bitch
Schreib dabei ein' Text und droppe die Hits
Und komm zurück und leck der Fotze die Clit

[Hook]

[Part 4: Kollegah]
Ich trag' nen Nerzpelzmantel
Kid, ein Punch und du drehst dich im Kreis so wie beim Square Dance tanzen
Ich hab Kokaplantagen
Du nennst dich Pimp, doch deine Hoe hat 'nen Bart wie Homer und Marge
Ich bin mit Pumpgun zu seh'n wie Saddam Hussein
Nigga, die Bitches in meiner Hood kommen zu tausenden in meinen Garten, um mich dann nur einmal zu sehen
Denn ich bin der Mac und habe the game
Spitte ein paar Lines zu dem Beat und mach' Cash
Komme in der Stretch-Limo zu deiner Freundin und die Hoe wird gebangt
Penner, sieh mich an, ich trage Pullover von Gucci, Armani
Kollegah der Businessman im silbenen Benz
Ist der King in dem Game und der Mac, Nigga
Vor ein paar Jahren verkaufte ich noch Handys am Bahnhof
Heute bin ich ständig im Radio so wie Nelly Furtado
Ich komm' im Cadillac an wie ein Star und kletter' mit Sunny die Charts hoch




I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell

The cycle starts: freestylin and ciphers at a party
Hardly no 'round town but still move bodies
The hotties only cut skills
Ungodly thoughts of "get it on" constantly bombard me
But I take everything in stride with time
Nowadays niggas ain't careful with their rhymes
Hey yo the glory that they all can't find
I sit and visualize how the shit would be mines
I got a plan with blueprints to sprint from one level to next from the rhymes I flex
So, who's ready to get whipped with text?
Grav fuckin your brain is the best of sex
If I had a condom, I still harmed 'em
Every time I thrust yo the condom would bust
I'm on a mission and I can't be stopped
First stage of a nigga tryna reach the top
Keep movin

I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)

Stage two of figuring out what to do to make things, these dreams manifest come true
Yo not to brag, but my rhymes is the fattest but it seems 'round town I got a whole new status
See now my name's gettin known and shit
Up in clubs always rockin microphones and shit
(Ay yo Grav, there's mad new faces around!)
Yo dips givin me hugs, niggas givin me pounds
But I gotta decipher who's real and who ain't
While a lotta niggas real more niggas is fake
Yo they got way too much time to kill
While I'm out bustin ass tryna pay my bills
Nine to five tried to rip a brother apart
But the rap game stayed deep down in my heart
Monduks always said (finish what you start)
It ain't a damn thing that can take me off my mark
Keep movin

I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin)
I move rhymes like retail
Make sure the shit sell
(Keep movin, keep movin, keep movin)

So in these hard times I hope and pray my heart finds the right path to take, the right moves to make
Avoid fakes so my soul ain't scarred cause the soul warned me of potholes in my lawn (word bond)
So I took heed to the warnin, that's why God blessed me with life every mornin
Yo plus I kinda find it strange how cause I make moves niggas think shit changed
(Ay yo Grav the same) Just closer to his visions, stayin on my toes, makin the decisions
To make all my talents manifest to achieve one goal: life with less stress
Knife damage on my back's made of metal, for the niggas that's gas my foot is on the pedal
To accelerate past your mental state for a head-on collision with fame with no brakes
Movin




[Hook: John Legend & Slum Village]
I'm calling (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)

[Verse 1: T3]
Come on, to my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A., every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York, women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much I guess
But to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows
I'm calling

[Hook: John Legend & Slum Village]
I'm calling (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (yeah maybe I'm selfish)

Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uhh, and don't be tryna come around my girl
Acting like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies I paid them Benjies, get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get em a clone
He said, "Ye you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold"
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heatrocks, spit like a beat box
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz, I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3L-dub, I'm calling

[Hook: John Legend & Slum Village]
I'm calling (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
What up Pam? How your little man doing in New Jersey?
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta, better believe it
Shanice, you're my piece from Compton, before I'm off the plane
Make sure you cop some trees to spark up
Danielle, ATL, got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you sent it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis
Take me to after parties, her name was Khari
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry
But, hey Kim, how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty, hate you show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love your girls though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

[Hook: John Legend & Slum Village]
I'm calling (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby

[Outro: John Legend]
I'm calling (calling)
Out to (out to)
All my (all my)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (I can't)
Let you (let you)
Be with no one
But me, baby

Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Yeah, that's the king

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Stop that movement, stop that movement
Y'all can't move me, this my movie
Y'all can't stop me, y'all too sloppy
Carbon copied, carbon
Same thing, in a room
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out, huntin' for the truth
I'm guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'
All this time searchin' hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Yeah, that's the king

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say, “Damn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on
I won't relish on the fact I'm vibin' on the future
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia
Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (Switzerland, ahahaha)

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Yeah, that's the king

[Bridge: Yasiin Bey]
Civilization without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability without stasis
Places and spaces
Civilization without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability without stasis
Spaces and places

[Outro: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts—ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Yeah, that's the king
And what's a crown for the clouds, movin' around
Yeah, that's the king
And what's a crown to the clouds, movin' around

Leftrak City. That's where I'm from. HEY! HEY! Oh oh!
Boola feel the beat. It's incredible. On the boards!
Aye yo big face yams. What up what up
Bring it back, bring it back to N.O.R.E. huh huh

[Noreaga]
Shit, ski mask, black on
Baseball bat strong
Slap a nigga, Warren Sapp style
Get my sack on
Offense, defense
Voice box secrets
Till a nigga diarrhea, shit dollars and pee cents
I've been always, on my grind
Nickname; Poppi, Jose, Slime
You've been hatin' from the sidelines
Very low
You've been hatin' when you hear me on the stereo
See me in a video
Same as in person
See me in the hood
No crew, one person
And I ain't gonna starve on this motherfuckin' planet
Till the whole world is talkin' about the kid like I'm Janet

[Hook: Kanye & GLC] [x2]
[K] I'm everything you wish you was
[G] You and me
[K] It's just us
[G] I've been drinkin'
[K] I'm tore up
[G] So please don't make my pistols bust
[G] I got homies that's with you
[G] So trust me I'm gonna get you
[K & G] Get you [x6]

[Noreaga]
Without a record out
Shit go down don't it?
What ever go up, it gotta go down don't it?
Martha Stewart guilty
While I was in that same court house
Same Feds try to do me
Feel my Shinobi sword
And you should know me Lord
Never back down, I back down
Niggas, you should know me Lord
Cowards fall on me
I can see them fallin' now
Raising your angles, write rhymes, pourin' out
Uplift with a curse and a gift
Rap for life
Read scripts
Load my clips
And Noreys still doin' my thing
Knock niggas out that's bigger than Yao Ming

[Hook]

[Noreaga]
I was innocent
Campin' in a tentament post
My coat cinnamon
Cooked it like beef that roast
I told shorty, get your talkin' on
You can't sell crack with your Walkman on
An ex-work hustla
I use to extort in an Escort, land to discover ah
Quick to move another place
Lawyer beat another case
Got Bruce off so he break yous all
Militainment and I'm Coups with the roofs off
We load from the dick
So off they radar
I just bought an AR
AK to spray y'all
Eat food, man I never stops
Whether you down with Militainment or not
I be forever

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On a scale of one to ten, what do you rate yourself
Here's some champagne, hydrate yourself
I know I'm lookin' good, you lookin' great yourself
I mean you shittin' on these bitches, you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My, my, my, whips is side-by-side
He just talkin', mine's outside
Do you mind if I
Take you on a test
Do you have all-wheel drive
And if that baby purr, I'm gonna baby her
Bitches gon' hate and maybe worse
Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work
I know you was on pur-pur
But this is a whole new arena
See, niggas come by talkin' bout they make it rain
I'll make that bitch Katrina
Mr. Kanye Omari, with my Entourage, no Ari
And a motorcycle jacket, no Harley
She said dude, that's cool
Gnarly

[Hook: 4X]
Alright alright, alright
Alright alright, alright
Alright alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2: Twista]
Twista where you at
Abracadabra, did he vanish
Hurry up and come out
But I ain't want to panic
I say that I'm in the zone
But they don't understand it
Physically I'm here but mentally I'm on another planet
And it only kinda made 'em look at me like I was stupider
Now they askin' which planet, is it Jupiter
So I let the money show cause I know stacks could talk
I'm mackin' on bitches with my intergalactic thoughts
In my Mercedes Benz
Pull up on a chick and holla at her and her lady friends
Like as rich as an Arabian
I'm kickin' pure flows
Euros they pay me in
For what I put together in the dungeon
I'm lookin' for a UK chick with a nice onion
Never beat it up like Paul Bunyan
And I can't believe they let an American Werewolf in London
Especially when drinking Gs with a tonic
Steady be trippin' while smokin' on the hydroponic
When I spit it like this they be callin' me bionic
Kanye with the Twist, nigga, how ironic
And I'm astonished haters don't wanna see me on
They wanna know how Twista get the easy dome
Swag off the chain, twenty-threes be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on
Gone

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Twista]
I'm blowin' on flame but yours is all white
And I'mma pull up in the Bentley all white
Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin' on some Louis and partyin' all night
Phony-ass people, I don't feel they demeanor
So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of rap's heroes, who came from zero
Makin' something out of nothing, call me Gilbert Arenas
Now I'm fuckin' with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back 'til my face be numb
I am the shit
It don't make me numb
Rockin' wit a swagger like I got an eight-feet gun
And my flow be colossal cause I spit the impossible
Whether with rhythm no limit to what I can do
See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle
And always get money no matter how illogical
I follow through because, uh

[Hook] - 10X




[Intro: Rihanna + (Kanye West)]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
(Swizz told me let the beat rock)

[Verse 1: Kanye West + (Swizz Beatz)]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Hook: Rihanna + (Swizz Beatz)]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
(Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!)
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Good God
Midwest coast back nigga
And don't say nigga unless of course you black nigga
Free country they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all they white daughters drinking Hennessy
I'ma go to Sal's, put some niggas on a wall
I might go to Oz take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano so involved
I know
King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had 2 polos
We the kids they keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They askin' bout the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff

[Bridge: Sister Nancy + (Swizz Beatz)]
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

[Intro]
Wake up Mr. West - Mr. West - Mr. West...
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Post-Hook: Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh

[Outro: Kanye West]
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

Crib and a car, man you know tha basics
Diamonds your best friend
That makes sense because
You a princess and you deserve the princess cuts
But as long as you gots ya defenses up
You can never get the love that was meant for ya
Shoot, you know that I "use to come through on da club tip"
Real thugs don't never fall in love

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I am the don of Vuitton
I am the Sean of Sean John (That's the boss nigga)
This is the [?]
I'm too complex for ComplexCon
You heard Cole on that song, he was tryna' hate
I am out of touch, I cannot relate
"Hallway too long, bitch too bad"
Got a surrogate," my kid "gets two dads"
How can one man take a company down?
I can see Nike contemplatin' that
"Like bro, we're fucked, what's the best plan?
I don't know, hire Ye's best man
Maybe sign Travis, sign Don C
Maybe get the [?]"
Ricky came by unattended
Sent Donda out in heaven, up with Avery
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' "What New Kids on the Block do?"
[?] like cribs on the block too
[?] we got cribs on the block too (Haa)
Drizzy wearin' Yeezys on the low though
Only reppin' Nike for promo
The company growin' faster than Flo-Jo
And we did it with no logo
It don't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
What was the six

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, said she’s down for the night
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh, ooohh
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh, ooohh (slow down the time)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, down for the night

[Verse: Kanye West]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon, Kanye West & Elly Jackson]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
Down for the night

[Bridge: Gil Scott Heron & Kanye West]
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night, down for the night
Oh, oh, get down

[Outro]
Hey, woah-ohh, hey, woah-ohh
Hey woah-ohh, hey-hey-hey!
Hey, woah-ohh, hey, woah-ohh
Hey woah-ohh, hey-hey-hey!
Hey, woah-ohh, hey, woah-ohh
Hey woah-ohh, hey-hey-hey!
Hey, woah-ohh, hey, woah-ohh
Hey woah-ohh, hey-hey-hey!

Asking me why the hell I test the cove
Four times I say don't test me, hoe
Told you four times don't test me, hoe

But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store

Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah a-yo Fab
I can tell they ain't used to this
I can tell they ain't
I can tell they ain't
I can tell they ain't used to this
I can tell they ain't used to this

With ya boy the Louis Vuitton Don
A.K.A. Marty McFly
And I'm on my fly shit
Straight from the Chi bitch

I can tell they ain't
I can tell they ain't they used to this

[Hook: Fabolous]
You keep askin' questions
Dumb ass suggestions
Must ain't never lived like this
Why the funny faces
Nah the funny taste
You just ain't never drink like this
You can't even lie
You probably got high
But you ain't never smoked like this
I see shoppin' bags
Might pop some tags
But you was never fly like this

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm a let your wife peep game
Get used to this shit
Introduce her to shit
Like Life meet Lane
Lane meet Life
Y'all two get acquainted
Its so cool bein' my new chick ain't it?
Let me explain it
I don't make up shit
I just Lorraine it maybe Jacob shit
Make a 36D from a A cup bitch
Sleep with me you might wake up with (With what?)
A set of keys to a pad and a Jag
Fendi sprees Paddington bags
Cockiness to add in your swag
Take a look at what you had and then gag
Like eww
Anybody know a girl that don't like heels? (Do you?)
That's like askin' is the nose on Mike real (Is it?)
Hell naw
Well ma
I'm here to catch you
They say men are dogs you know what I'm here to fetch you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh Roc-A-Fella
Black people usin' black cars, isn't it ironic?
Smokin' weed on the yacht isn't it the chronic?
Plus the hoes good
Its feelin' like Rosewood
That black baller bullshit, we on it
Cops will pull you over like isn't there a problem?
No sir
But I realize the windows so blur
That you might've mistaked a nigga for a chauffeur
Ya might mistake that backseat for a sofur (sofa)
Now the dreads said to rap on everything
Cause he know that I snap on everything
Listen, when my flow commissions
It caused the commissioner to throw a cap on everything
My accountant said
If I get the crib on the side of the mountain
Right beside the fountain
And decide on the Phantom
I'll go broker than Hammer
Performin' in pajamas
Damn it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous (Kanye West)]
My flow got teeth marks in it and I know who the biters is
(Can't blame them but whoever they writers is)
Matter fact whoever the dick riders is
(Get your own style don't Winona Ryder his)
Ferrari Fab or you could say Spyder Spizz
(SLR pullin' up on the side of his)
Shorties success ain't even near the height of his
This dudes paper thinner than E-Z Wider is
(I made me laugh yo
But if you do the math though)
I've been gettin money since Kojak had an Afro
(I've been fresh since
Will Smith was a Fresh Prince)
Had hoes when Kermit was a tadpole
(So of course the officers wanna off us)
Came off the corner to up in the corner office
(I thought it was livin')
They call it ballin'
(It been like this)
Where the hell all of y'all been?

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye West - x2]
I can tell they ain't used to this
I can tell they ain't
I can tell they ain't
I can tell they ain't used to this

[Intro]
Are you going to be, say that you're gonna be

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She say she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton, will definitely set this party off right
Yes it well, oh yes it will
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yes it will, it definitely will! You know what I told her?
I told her to "Drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie, like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World,she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't a freak, so you gotta prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right

[Interlude: Aisha Tyler & Kanye West]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
And it's good, it's all good, it's beautiful, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster, baby
Can you please? Do it faster baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast...
But I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
With a shot, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of "Roll It Slow"
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin' me and still gon' be in love with me, and I ride...

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She say she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton, will definitely set this party off right
Yes it well, oh yes it will
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Verse 3: Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that, then I take it to the dome
Then I got to bone, stay up in the zone
Got to get you home, gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that then I, take you to my home
We can get it on, disconnect the phone
Trying to get you gone, I'mma make you moan
And I'll do it (Well well well well)




[Intro: Kanye West]
Long Beach, stand up! (Plain Pat, what up?)
It's your hometown boy Mark Spitz and uh
Now I've been getting fucked up all night long
This weed and this drink I got is almost gone
And I've been doing wrong my whole life long
So here's my song
Here's my song

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]
Five pounds of dro
Five rounds or mo'
Tore from the flo'
Two sets of hoes
K. West to go
(Okay no more for me
Okay one more for me)
[X2]

[Verse 1: Mark Spitz]
Let me talk on this
Let me walk on this
Mark Spitz extra clips of hollow tips
I'm full throttle with Chicago trips
Hits model chicks without the bread
Moet bottles flip, I'm out my head
Yeah
Okay no more for me
Fuck it, one more for me
Send another round around for all my Gs
Quarterback in the streets
Throw a zip for three
Mr. MC on the beats that still spin when I freeze
In the city by the sea, bitch
Feel the breeze
Hot head, I got steel to squeeze
See easy

[Bridge: Mark Spitz]
The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
'kay?
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks
Dimes and hoodrats, get down on the flo'
And pop that ass 'til it's time to go

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]

[Verse 2: Mark Spitz]
I came to the club with a gang of niggas
But I left from the club with a gang of bitches
Just got my pimp cup now my name is Bishop
In a money green suit, ice cane and lizards
The P chain still hangs but it's changed to Spitz
The blues always authentic gangsta shit
Now take this and run with it
Go have fun with it
But make sure you bring it back when you're done with it
Long Beach done done it again
It's been ten
And we've been it since then as little kids
You niggas can't tell me shit on how to sell with this
I'm hot as hell, we done done it again

[Bridge: Mark Spitz]

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Don't worry Chi-town
It's ya boy Kanye To The
I got this!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You at the bar tryin' to ask what that Hypno hit fo'
If you gotta ask that you can't afford to get mo'
Dawg, slow down you can't afford to sip Mo'
Leave the club now, come back when you get dough
Many hoes, many many many many many hoes
Centerfolds, especially I'm in the Go
Cadillac back to back, red, black to indigo
Tell me that I ain't pimpin' yo
Especially they in a row?
Keep a least two, that can't keep they cool
Cause I stay G'd up like the first week of school
Broke girls, I take 'em to the Section 8
Where I pass the dick around like a collection plate
White girls said, "La Di Da Di, we love to party"
And that bitch ain't broke so that mean she sniff coke
And she only 17 so that mean she can't vote
So if we do anything, that mean you can't quote

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]




Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam




[Intro: DeRay Davis]
Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil' som...
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids are gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for graduation to sing?




[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a—when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe, believe

Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo

Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like—

And it still have one more time left
Cuh the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder

[Verse 3: Kanye West & 2 Chainz]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (Yah)

You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (Baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (Damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (Yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (Rain) pourin' (Pourin')

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Uh, ah, fuck it, we all poor
Even if you got money, still lookin' for more
Why am I buyin' Rollies? I got 20 for sure
Still connect witchu, it's still hid in the drawer
With no Js on, I'm still lookin' to score
You see they gave us crack, then started wagin' a war
Uh, all these lies, they steady tellin' me
Before Obama, we had Eric B. (Woo)
Or Tony Lewis out in D.C.
The 80's kingpins, gotta free them
All these faces, they ain't believe in
If no child's left, then how can we leave them?

[Chorus 1: Lauryn Hill]
When love is gone, you hold onto anything
Some do wrong, just to feel anything
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
When love is real, you can do anything
(You can do anything)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Uh, I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)
For my street-corner survivors (Survivors)
For my niggas that miss The Wire (Woo)
And throwback mamis, that won't retire
Reminiscin' on the days
When the trips was Cancún and the bottles got sprayed
You can't relate 'cause you wasn't there
Nah, you wasn't hot, let me make it clear
Y’all was breakin' into cars, we was breakin' bad
When y’all was fightin' dogs, we was racin' Jags
This the life for the fast
Ain't no future, ain't no past, we won't worry 'bout the crash, uh
Now it's jail poses and club pictures
Airbrush backdrops and jail visits
This the dope boy song for the dope boys gone
Let 'em know it's still snowin'

[Chorus 2: Lauryn Hill]
When love's withdrawn, you hold onto anything
(You hold onto anything)
Some do wrong, they have to do anything
(They have to do anything)
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
(You stand up to anything)
When love is real (When love is real)
You can do anything (You can do anything)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I'm speakin' to the soul of my black native bros
Who ain't get to go to school like a J. Cole
Who ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll
Who weren't taught the golden rule, but they made do?
Free lunches and apple juices, uh
Food stamps, ashamed to use 'em
You ever lived with the user?
Shared a bed with abusers, that's the worst way to lose 'em

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill]
New plan, but it's a new day
Black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free in a new way
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's a new day, black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free, in a new way
Said it's not over, it's not over
Yes, it's just started, it's just started

[Chorus 3: Lauryn Hill]
When love is strong, you can do anything
Things go wrong, but you'll stand up to anything
(But you'll stand up to anything)
'Cause when the void is filled, you can do anything
(When the void is filled)
When the love is real, you can do anything




[Intro: Ryan Leslie]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm in the club doin the same old two step
While Omegas doin the same old Q step
I have my money on my mind she was thinkin' green
She's a pledge AKA she was kickn' green
I want a good girl she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard I need censorship
I'm a Chicagoian till Chicago end
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know I'm gettin' one, the other's gettin' away

[Hook: Ryan Leslie]

[Outro: Ryan Leslie]
Yeah! (Your my diamond girl) I know you wanna hear it again

Uh! Just rock with it (Your my diamond) (It's Next Selection)
(Your my diamond girl!)




[Intro: John Legend]
Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Oh oh oh oh, I'm good, so good, so good

[Refrain: Kanye West]
It's your boy, Kanye to the
And we back
Feeling better than ever, huh?
Yo John, can't complain, huh?
Shit nigga, you got a deal on Def Jam
Got Cons' with me, we in the works
Got my best friend GLC, the Knockout King
Through the doctor's exact calculations
He said, "Nigga, you almost bust the Final Destination
Shit, you must have had a blessing from Pastor Mason"
'Cause that trip to L.A. could have been my last vacation, what?
I mean, there's people at war right now
We can't be sitting up here, complaining about the bills
Complaining about whatever beef we may have
We good, man, we blessed




[Verse 1: Brandy]
What ya hear this time
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lying
It's always somethin
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now the whole hoods buzzin
He said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop
They just want what we got

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

[Verse 2: Brandy]
I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon show and prove

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Heres a couple of things I can't honor man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man
I'm wonderin why she ret ta go like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I trade in my cash
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said "You so nuts!"
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get that new number
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

[Outro: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out
I don't wanna hear it no more




[Verse 1]
Pullin' up in that new toy
The wrist on that boy rockstar like Pink Floyd
Waving at rude boy, I'm wavin' at you, boy
Ran off on the plug too like Trugoy
Imagine me do-boy, you could never do what I do, boy
Still, duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy; ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago – if you know, you know (Yeah)

[Break]
If you know, you know

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)

[Verse 2]
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

[Verse 3]
You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to weigh, "Do you war or wait?"
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
(If you know, you know)
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
I've been hidin' where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle 'round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)




[Intro]
I'm just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I don't control the colors

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like "Mack maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself"
So what I do? I take heed and pick up the pace
Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crackin' the pavement
There that voice go again "Mack practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements"
Keep thinkin' of them hot lines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, it's nothing like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, what you want from me
What you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb

[Verse 2]
But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Qur'an and 48 laws, they polish my flaws
I'm movin' niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mack
To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mack was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shinin' at night
Imagine it dog, I know you wanna see me gradually fall
But I'm walkin' on air, breakin' every gravity law
It's nothin' like it, I swear
I spit words that skip through air
Let the words of a true thug hit your ear
It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
It's nothin' like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas

[Verse 3]
I changed my whole life in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
These young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
Try to tell them "you can burn young punk without smellin' the fumes"
Make you shiver in the middle of June
Paint a picture so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
Shine bright like a prism, displayin' colors like Crayola
Think of the prisons with straight soldiers
Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I'm paintin', it's so perfect
Open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
No survivors every soul shall suffer
I'm loadin' up revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise it's like jihad with these mags, I'ma bust ya

[Outro]
Goddamn it's nothin' like it, I'm serious
Can't explain how I write it

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for a girl birthday
They ordered champagne while they look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom-ish

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna hit it hard on the sink
After that, get you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the girls I got the worst rep
But hey, that backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your chick for other chickens?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to furrget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]

Uncle Charlie's' in the house, watch your mouth
Bound...

[Hook]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
(Uh-huh, honey)




[Verse 1]
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules

[Refrain]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 2]
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules

[Refrain]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

[Bridge]
Oh, you just gon' keep another no you won't
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

[Outro]
What's on the news?
Channel cruise

And got the whole world shakin just like crack phiends
Heavy hitters for life

[Intro: Consequence]
The conman, aw, damn, we back in town, word

[Hook: Consequence]
I'm sick and tired of you sittin' around here all day
I'm sick and tired of you smokin' weed in the hallway
But why you worried about me?
Why you worried about what I'm doin' here?
Why you got to embarrass me in front of company?

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Damn, you back from your trip
I thought the plane would have helped you over
Stop sellin' crack out the crib, yeah, when hell freeze over
Until the (?) over, hard to fly wings over
Dog, you talkin' way too fast, tell me it slower
You seen my boys is over, (?) wasn't right
Cause my feet is on the sofa and I never fill up the (?)
A man (?), dog, I ain't got my half
But if you buy me this, ma, I promise I'll pay you back
But the way you act, I be really want to see you dead
Plus it's four hundred missin' from under my bed
They put me in arrest and have you beat them 'bout the iron
When them niggas rushed the crib
I was the one that poured the ice in them

[Hook: Consequence]
I'm sick and tired of you sittin' around here all day
I'm sick and tired of you smokin' weed in the hallway
But why you worried about me?
Why you worried about what I'm doin' here?
Why you got to embarrass me in front of company?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We have, we have in this corner the dead heat roommate
Fresh from his momma crib
He embossed the market thanks to my sponsorship
I ain't finna argue 'bout what we finna watch, dog
We finna watch Fox and the weed finna (?)
I can't even bring hoes to my spot
You be tryin' to thug 'em out, roommate version of Pac
When it's not grievin' when I ask where you'd be
You told me like (?), he beat the shit out of me
Then you borrowed my clothes, don't do that
It's makin' me nervous, I found my bird in my (?) book
Can't find my Julius Erving
You from a family of alchies and I'm (?)
But I'm feelin' like Perfect Strangers
Cause you about to crowd me, get the fuck out

[Hook: Consequence]
I'm sick and tired of you sittin' around here all day
I'm sick and tired of you smokin' weed in the hallway
But why you worried about me?
Why you worried about what I'm doin' here?
Why you got to embarrass me in front of company?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You got all these Halle Berry posters in the crib
How you think she feel about you havin' roaches in the crib?
I got my name on the orange juice, posted in the crib
She drinkin' out the pitcher like most of it was his
Nigga, what the fuck you did with my pornos and comic books?
How come I never got the message that my people said you took?
Look, who the fuck you down with?
Cause them chromes is off the hook
It's like the (?) of Rhode Island every time you try to cook
You try to cook, nigga, look, I don't ever try to cook
I just been tryin' to get back that money that I loaned your ass
Off the books, off the books, yep, a month ago
You must have forgot, you must be thinkin' that I'm rich
Because I'm rollin' with the rocks

[Verse 4: Consequence]
Ayo, it ain't that I forgot, it's that the (?) is callin'
And you never paid me back
From the time that you broke the toilet
You can (?) us out for callin' to my new vacant house
Cause I need my own space, so I'm sorry you bought 'em out

[Hook: Consequence]
I'm sick and tired of you sittin' around here all day
I'm sick and tired of you smokin' weed in the hallway
But why you worried about me?
Why you worried about what I'm doin' here?
Why you got to embarrass me in front of company?




[Kanye West]
Yo Bump, I just want to make sure everybody knew who did the track
Kanye-to-the, with the GOON SQUAD!

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's

Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
Move around now, move around now

[Verse 1: Bump J]
I ain't going back to doing a book a day
I'm at this rap full time, my future's lookin' great
Feds not convinced, think I'm still movin' weight
Move around clowns, don't even look my way
Bump's a hustla, got cheddar to check in
For real you would die for whatever you reppin'
You smart, you would carry a weapon
Mines'll make you do a back flip better than Mary Lou Retten
I'll shoot somethin' up, I'm from grimeyville
You know it's shoes on that truck if I'm behind the wheel
They know me and so I got it locked I remind them still
Cause every line that I put up in a rhyme is real
And you wonder why the label shoot you down
Your album will never leave the shelf cause you's a clown
Look at me, flickin' somethin' serious through the town
You rap niggas couldn't be serious, move around now

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's
Bout pickin' and choosin'
You don't know when you won

[Verse 2: Bump J]
See there, it ain't poppin' 'less we there

That's a nine if you failed math, I bail pass in that pale Jag
Cause I push weight and you sell bags
Come and cop that from me
My [diesel?] have cluckers noddin off like they ain't slept in weeks
Whoever disrespect the chief
I'll have the Tec put you pets to sleep
That's all you birds I catch singing to detects police
You ain't my dogs, you rats and you cats can rest in peace
I post up on a deck for weeks
You can ask K-West, I'm a masterpiece!
I got a good name, and I spit good game
Tried ya baby mama out, and she got good brains
I look lames in the face and tell 'em
You ain't a Goon, you's a fruit, I'm a gansta mella

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's

Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move

[Verse 3: Bump J]
Look, I got a crazy flow so while you hatin' Joe
I'm off in Mejico posin', frozen H20
Around my neck and wrists, a couple ladies so
If I was to go tonight, it's all gravy Joe
Went from the US to USSR
In the best private jets nigga, you just test cars
But when I am on my land, I'm stylin'
My rims chop like the karate man from Shaolin
And the Goons hit the club, and pile in
We in these streets wildin', chumps where ya'll been?
We move around, I'm off on the islands sipping daiquiris
See why you niggas so mad at me
I'm enjoying the rewards of this hip hop
On the West Coast in my tank top and flip flops
Smoking something you can smell through the zip lock
Never find another nigga this hot, no

[Hook: Bump J]
Shawty you know the game's
Bout pickin' and choosin'
You don't know when you won
You so used to losin'
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move
I know you see me tryna party homey
Give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me
And click ta clack boom!
Move around now, move around now
Move around now, move around move




[Intro x2: Kanye West]
Will I ever change in this life?
My grandma said I'll never change and she right
Y'all think that L.A. gang banging shit hype?
Well you finna' find out what the game be like

[Verse 1: Game]
Red rag on my rear view
No tint in the Porsche, see clear through
God screaming up out them speakers
So loud that a nigga can't hear you
Wake up to a diamond cross, I'm a Christian
Got a nigga feeling like Obama 'nem
Niggas shot out my windows, they jealous and envy
They spit on my 'Rari, they keyed up my Bentley
They went at my top dog like Ab-Soul and Kendrick
I said I'm a killa', god damn it I meant it
I said I sold crack, nigga bubbling skillets
At my grandma's house, I was selling work in it
And god bless her soul, she died
Back out the four, load up the five
Pop up the trunk, load up them pies
Aye 'Ye, ain't this how them niggas do it in the Chi?
Vice Lords, GD's
Crips, Bloods and Impala's on gold D's
Yesterday a nigga swore he was a man in the hood
Now he begging for his life on both knees
I'm a killer, no codees
Ask 40 Glocc, niggas don't know me
Got a problem blood, then come show me
I'm on Rosecrans ing them Kobe's
Got diamonds off in my Rollie
Granddaddy stuffed in my stogie
Motherfuck them Axel Foleys
Where I'm from, niggas shooting at the police
Man these fuck niggas got me screwed up
I'm like Papa Smurf in that blue truck
Red hat, red pants
Walking inside dreams with the kush in my hand - I'm

[Hook x4: Z-Ro]
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' them drugs up

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
Young nigga 15, broke, livin’ the scene
Sawed off in my pants, ‘bout to go make the lean
Finna' rob me a nigga who’s money wasn’t the same
Somebody gon' give it to me, or get one up in the brain
Mama used to stroke it just to feed me scraps
Every Saturday, it was YO! MTV raps
Got sick of looking at other niggas that ain't deserve it
So I followed my older brother to beat these traps
I ain't worried about the love, I've seen everything
The hood hot, like the devil had it off in his hands
Send a strap your way, I seen a couple of fans
Last pack, I took that and a couple of bands
If I ain't hustle to eat, I was doing that sippin' Screw
But they would give it to me, everyday I was paying dues
I was a young wild nigga missing a couple screws
In the hood, when I'm scared, only thing I'mma use, when I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Mane, hold up
Young and I leans with a cup full of lean, and a 4-0 tucked
No more sleep, gotta get more bucks, OG rolled up
Stakes are high, so I pray to God the folks don't roll up
Big sister told me I need to grow up
But I need that money, better not crumb me
Pockets fat as my codeine tummy
Trying to get blow like my nose was runny
I work for mine, you can't take that from me
Wrap it up, like Egyptian mummy
And have it ready when I roll on up
Stacking dough on up, from the floor on up
And I'm all through the hood like ice cream trucks, just rollin'

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
Keep kush rolled, that dream I'm holding
In the candy Caddy' with with ninety molding
Bought a drop, put it in the shop
But everything I got, on that bitch stolen
Had a grill but couldn't afford the wheels
Had paint, but it wasn't candy
Kick endo to try and get that dough
Whole family know, so they couldn't stand me
Run and tell your mama, come get your son
Mama like damn, what the hell he done
Brother had bricks, but didn't give me shit
So when he went to the pen, I ain't send him shit
Mama at work, so I ran the house
Ray on lock, so now I'm the boss
Turn that face up like the Mary Jane
I was slanging 'caine, got us all kicked out

[Hook]

[Outro: Game]
From Compton, all the way to Chi-Town
Back on down to Houston, Texas baby
Trae The Truth, Z-Ro, Slim Thugga
Paul Wall, Common, Kanye West, and The Game
Jesus Piece
Either you got one, you want one
Or you bout to rob a nigga for one
So what it's gon' be nigga?
(Gun shots, laughs)




[Intro]
Yeah, put your hands in the air, North Sea
Yeah yeah, it's like this y’all, yeah
Let me hear ya say 'Yeah'
Say ’Oh yeah'
Say 'The real hip-hop'
At North Sea
Check it

[Verse]
I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay
Everything a nigga do may not be what he might say"
Chicago nights they, stay on the mind
I write many lives, they, lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I looked into my daughter’s eyes
Realize I’ma learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin ’em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just want to be...

And you say North Sea
Make some noise
Where my peoples at here from Amsterdam?
What about Rotterdam?
Den Haag?
What about the US?




[Pusha T]
Cars with chauffeurs sockless loafers
Snap my finger nigga buenos noches
We the Black Cards
Bar none put whoever on us
My jewels is like a flute to you bitches
I'm the snake charmer

[Ab Liva]
You can’t keep following niggas that break honor
I'm driven in that double R I- drive system
More horses near the pistons
The logistics the left arm glisten
As I exit the car with the partition

[Sandman]
And half of you niggas wishing
Y’all was in our position getting
Sloppy kisses from model bitches
By rocky wrist’s
Or the unbelievable vehicle breezing through
Leaving you pissed whispering
Life is a bitch

[Pusha T]
Every dollar ever tricked was never missed
Im trifling rich i mannequin hoes to floss my shit
To every bitch i ever barbie-dolled
It was only to heighten and enlighten
But instead i just misguided y’all

[Ab liva]
They document the rise and fall of footprints
Of hustlers turn legends in they times of war
Blow money cars line the shore
We reincarnated with their stars faded
And they crimes were flawed

[Sandman]
While y'all niggas Scarfacing whole face in the soft
Busy sniffing to your nostrils raw and your nose fall off
Me and my niggas is living the difference
Flipping the pigeons [?]

[Pusha T]
I fell off in the pot in the kitchen
Peeling open them pigeons
Pure white like the powder was christian
Ain't no such thing as a seven
Unless you’re talking McLaren
Those scissor doors open like the Gangster heaven

[?] to Boston George
To Philadel' like it's martial law
Gun drawn the sun fall on the concrete
Jungle as they juggle
All my shit in crack spots the nerve
The label me slumlord

[Sandman]
Evicted stupid ass young bulls
Playing with loot playing your stoop
Selling you dry wall
I guess you feeling Bruce Willis
Cause you going to die hard
Chasing you breath
While facing your death
As we slide off

[Pusha T]
We never mind cost
Croc and alligator shit lives lost
Closet like the Land of the Lost
PETA screaming murder
Furs you never heard of
Drowned in that shearling
I'm the fucking sheep herder

[Ab Liva]
These young niggas jump in the game
Hoping to leap further
Now that Fire white ice adores is a
Sleeve burner in love with a mean corner
Mean earner think sweet my burner
I have you fight for your life like you
C-Murder

[Sandman]
She's perfect we stepping through
Black white like Pepe Lepew
Bright lights what these gremlins spew
No Strife when you catch these few
You past due
Coast to coast hood to hood
Get money playa it's all good
Niggas tussle to struggle
Scuffle to hustle to muffle to muscle
Fall back damn I really would love to
But can't though
Coast to coast hood to hood
Get money playa it's all good
Niggas tussle to struggle
Scuffle to hustle to muffle to muscle
Fall back damn I really would love to
But can't though




Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me "don't touch me"
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said "I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes"
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said "Ye' you don't love me"
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly




[Intro: Consequence]
Yo, this Consequence
From the mighty Kon Man Clique
And I'm runnin' with my man Kanye West
And when I ain't got a pretty ho transporting a boy and a girl to the states
I'm either on the 1-9-2 or out in the Chi
So we gonna up y'all on how we chill, uh
Let's go

[Kanye West]
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridget
And get acquitted and break that bitch off, cause he ain't did it
Here go the Henny swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler, damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin' killer Cali gettin' weeded, make it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many B.I.s, so much inspiration

[Consequence]
I get inspired by the stunts too
I've run through (uh), so many bitches in one crew
That now they riff over bones to pick
Till I find one, and slide one
Take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this
Cause Quence is famous for totin' stainless

[Kanye West]
Hey miss, who's there? No time to do hair
I'm through here, the show tonight, so get right
You look aight, let's club now
A rub down starts flavor while we grind in the theater
I'm tryin' to cut in the movies
I'm tryin' to give her something else to drink 'sides a smoothie

[Consequence]
Kids get broke when I take bank and win
With the gold chains, I throw game at your bitch like handball
Cause your boy's all that
So fall back, I be that real for '03 till

Chorus: Consequence & Kanye West
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till

[Verse Two: Consequence]
My mack game does me well
And makes them hoes want to go and kiss and tell
All of Quence's business, I cause dizziness
Any time I got to go and slap a silly trick

[Kanye West]
Yo, niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin', them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese

[Consequence]
When I'm postin' you better tell them hot heads, "Stay cool"
Or exit because I'm the exception to the rule
I'm reppin' through the dudes blocks with two Glocks
To bury ya; when they tear they ain't jammin'
Them cannons will make you drop
So I'm doin' sliffs of indo, showin' off for hoes
Basically, my ace has been makin' them sick tracks
While I was shootin' pornos with your wisdom

[Kanye West]
Now bring some more stacks before you ask
About the price of the tracks; the game on smash
Look, don't change the facts about these plaques
'Cause in fact, my freestyle hours over powers
Brothers can't hack it, sensitive to truth and mack bitch
'03 me, Quence and Plain Pat bitch

Chorus: Consequence & Kanye West
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till
This is how we chill from '03 until
This is how we chill for '03 till

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? You niggas all fed up ‘cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" – gotta move carefully
‘Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me — oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryin' do me
If the record's two mil I'm just tryin' move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?

[Hook: Bobby Bland + Jay Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
And then the Fugees gonna break up
Now everyday I wake up, somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96 that I came to take this shit
And I did handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Hook: Bobby Bland + Jay Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad ‘cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies — why you all aggie?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit; where's the love?

[Hook: Bobby Bland + Jay Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (Amazing) yeah I'm all that (All that)
If I ain't on my grind, then what you call that? (What you call that?)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive off victory (Yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure, either let the Feds catch ya (Yeah)
I'm amazing, born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon, summertime, no June
Big family, small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard?
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

[Outro: Kanye West]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing




[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We'll be brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be brothers forever
We'll be brothers forever
We'll be brothers forever
(Brothers forever)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
You should've lit cigars, when your baby was born
Should've shouted you out and dedicated a song (Oh, oh)
I can say I was wrong, I can take the blame
'Cause brothers don't always have to share the same name
(Oh, oh)
We met when we was young, I forgot the grade
When last one to base was a rotten egg
Since then I done good and rotten things (Brothers forever)
So I could tell you one thing (Brothers forever)
As soon as I cut the grass low
It's easier to see the assholes
So I'm sorry for all the miscues
How about I admit that I miss you
I miss the fam and our brotherhood
I just wanna make sure that my brother's good
So I ain't embarrassed or above (Eh, eh)
Flying out to Paris for a hug
Or picking up the phone just to call up (Ooh)
Picking up the phone hope it's all love
'Cause Jesus taught us love, so did Moses and Mohammed (Ooh)
So nothing so atomic that we can't agree to drop it, chop it
Peace it up and get it poppin'
And bury the hatchet so we can lock in (Ohh-oh)
Why don't you still have him on the line?

[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We'll be (Woo) brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
(Brothers forever)

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
I wish I had a PA system for all the brothers we love
For the ones that was missing but joined the cut where we from
See how the DA did 'em, when they was hustling drugs
And that was in the city of brotherly love
See brothers are amused by other brother's reps
But it takes a real one to keep the other in check (Other in check)
So this fraternity's for eternity (Brothers forever)
And every rhyme I write is 25 to life (Brothers forever)
Every dime I wife thought I was Brian McKnight
And my homies said that you should shine your light
And the groupies gave us the time of our life
And I think about those times when I'm flying a flight
And I knew we'd reconnect when the timing was right
Man, I ain't spoke to you in like forever (Brothers forever)
Maybe it's time we put the band back together

[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We'll be brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
Brothers forever

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Brothers forever (Uh, oh)
We'll be brothers forever (Oh)
Brothers forever, brothers forever (Ooh, ooh)

And we back, and we back, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Hey, this ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh-igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third

[Chorus: Kanye West & Chance The Rapper]
This is the bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom

Music all we got, got, got
Music is all we got
Oh, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper, Chance The Rapper & Kanye West]
Ayy, ayy, I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some Earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give Satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothin' away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothin' away
'Cause at the end of the day

[Chorus: Kanye West & Chance The Rapper]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Oh, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got (Huh, huh)
Music is all we got (Huh, huh)

We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Wise came home Far Rock edge, man; I figured I'd drop in (WHOOOO!)
Bless him with a lil' short change to go shoppin'! (YEAH!)
Buzzer don't work! - Elevator shitty staircase pissy
His sister ran out huggin' on a nigga, she missed me! (what?)
Momma living room, she sipped Cristy till she was pissy! (whoooo!)
Told 'em niggas tried to blaze me last night but they missed me
In the CL, some niggas wet the driver side door, (uh-huuuh!)
I had my vest on. - I put the fuckin\' pedal to the floor! (AAAAAHHHH!)
Her son facin' her - for a less or tens, he hurtin'
They be hollerin' like: "50, let us put some work in!"
Today's a nice day if tonight's a nice night, - somebody gon' die
It is what it is my nigga; why ask why?!
See? I stay with some s*it in the street
But the niggas Uptown love me like they love Pistol Pete. - You heard me?

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
Haha, haha!
BRAAAAAAAAAAAAATT!
Y'all n*ggas eat that, n*gga!
Live with that!

[Verse 2: Scarface]
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck bein a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me..

[Verse 3: Lloyd Bank$ {50 Cent}:]
I had my eyes on the Mascara, - mami, the Maybelline queen;
Dolce Gabana, Fergano gettin' choked in the sauna. [explosion]
She had a - dot on her face like Madonna, (Madonna!) dressed like she date a designer. (designer!)
Looks so good, I spent a day with her mama. {whoooo!}
Tried to break her, bring her, beat her, eat a plate of lasagna, {uh-huuuuh!}
Grab some paper, bring the heater in case it's haters behind her. {AAAAHH!}
They call me "Bandana Bank$", baby, I clap your homie, homie
Then I'm through with her, - go holla at Macaroni Tony, {TONY YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYO!}
In the back with a few cup of Henny, baggy pants to tuck the semi
In case you get to fuckin\' friendly. - My clique as tough as any! {any!}
Stuntin' plenty, I don't trick a penny; {haha!} get your own shit!
Callin' me with questions will only get you a phone click. - ! (!)

[Hook: Scarface]
I can squeeze without blinkin', I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta




[Intro: The Mighty Hannibal]
I wanna talk to all you addicts out there
That's got yourself a great big Jones
An' you done tried all the methadone
An' you just can't leave that heroin alone
I wonder, have you tried

[Verse 1]
Dope just touched down, I'm so grateful
Numbers so low, bitch, be thankful
They say don't let money change you
That's how we know money ain't you
Bitch, I been had, bitches been bad
We buy big boats, bitch, I'm Sinbad
Downright sinful, bitch, we been full
All my dopeboys, we like kinfolk
BMore burnt spoon, DC glass pipe
VA sent bales, 'bout that trap life
Blew through thousands, we made millions
Cocaine soldiers, once civilians
Bought hoes Hondas, took care children
Lent my pastor, build out buildin's
Rapped on classics, I been brilliant
Now we blend in, we chameleons, ahh!

[Chorus: George Jackson]
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—

[Verse 2]
Who else got the luxury to drop when he want
'Cause nobody else can fuck with me? What a show-off
Nigga, wrist for wrist—let's have a glow-off
Fuck it, brick for brick—let's have a blow-off
If we go by connections made
I can still climb ladders when complexions fade (Yugh)
White on white, that's the Testa
Black on black, that's the Tesla
See these diamonds in this watch face?
All that shit came from pressure
They don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind
And they tired of dancin' like a Ying Yang Twin
You can't have the Yin without the Yang, my friend
Real niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (Yugh!)
Can't escape the scale if I tried, interstate trafficking's alive
Push

[Chorus: George Jackson]
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—

[Verse 3]
Still fresh off the boat, niggas
Don't make me super-soak niggas
Your life ends up a quote, nigga
The good die young, all dogs go to heaven
It's really just momma's fallin' out on the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich flair before they was Ric Flair's
Cocaine concierge, longest runnin' trapper of the year
Stood the test of time like Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarain's
Is he still in the caravan? (No)
It's a mil' in the caravan? (Whoa)
Richard Mille on a leather band (Whoo)
Behind the wheel like an ambulance (Go)
On my way up to Maryland (Gone)

[Chorus: George Jackson]
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I—I can't—




[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, the Roc in here (yeah)
It's ya boy Kanye To The
Listen up man

[Verse]
I got girls in my room like hostages
Giving me neck like ostriches
Give some play to the real Kanye
'Cause we all know who the imposters is
All my gangsters, mob to this
And all my strippers, do your job to this
Hell no, I can't give you my cell phone
But you know where the hotel lobby is
For ya'll the same girls wouldn't give me no ass
Now I done highly surpassed my whole upper class
Bet if I meet her now I can fuck her fast, I pass
I be on some new shit
I wouldn't fuck none of the girls I went to school with
Fuck around, I ain't be on no cool shit
Like you don't see the models that me and my crew get
You don't see the frivolous jewels I bought with The Blueprint
She said "Whoa! Kanye don't get caught up in the hype
Ain't no telling they gon' love you after the night"
Well, if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money till you're broke my, nigga, live your life
'Cause I'm living international nigga American dream
And all my dawgs living vicariously through me
So if I get head from Trin', that one for the team
Fuck 702, that one for the crew
My dawg Hip Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Just like the Brinks trucks, they know it's money inside

[Outro]
Uh huh, (uh huh)
The Roc in here




[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin' like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]
I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers, we the roses

[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]
I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Break: Bill Withers]
Oh, Rosie brings the sunshine, oh

[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]
I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Hook: Bill Withers & Patti LaBelle]
I, smile, when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine (say)

[Outro: Patti LaBelle]
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no

A new chapter she was after so I said let's

[Intro: Dame Dash]

[Kanye West]
Well Dame, if these niggas thought about they self for a change
Then maybe they can finally figure out how to get they self some change
I done seen jealousy make niggas do t-terrible things
How'd that song go I did with HOV, oh yeah -- shit'll never change
Not to worry, though – we are the cham-p-ions
Spend a lot of time in Hampt-i-ons, do a lot of beats you can't be on
Damn all these fans can't be wrong, damn B.I.G. you can't be gone
Make those beats thugs want to rock, make a nigga feel just like 'Pac
Make it street but it just might pop, make it straight to the mountain top
Had the Chi' on lock, when they finally heard I signed with Roc
Came in the game, changed it again, changed everything, yeahhhhh
If you feeling this here, throw your fucking hands in the air

[Young Chris]
Its the Roc-a-Fella label baby fuck them other labels baby
And we been ducking shots from all them haters lately
We getting paper baby, them others trying to keep up

We labelled as the Roc-A-Fellas, Jacob, watch's colors
Everywhere hell yea, test us and the gauges BLOW!
Fuck they hatin fo'? Don't make me pop a fella

[Beanie Sigel]

No we the illest niggas; realest, I will kill these niggas!!

[Dame Dash]
Now that's what the fuck I'm talking bout!
And you wonder why I'm proud of my family?
And you wonder why I ain't gotta rap?
I got niggas that will assassinate you B, lyrically!
Really shut you the fuck down!! Don't get your career ended
Leave us the fuck alone, let us rock!
We are Roc-Heusen, we're the R., O., C. - HOLLA!

[Cam'Ron]
I'm here Dame, I'm here, Killa
This is just fate, how I would sit on a crate
Listen to tapes, every day a frisk was at stake
Jakes' cuffs, wrists getting raped; my mission was straight -- to
Visit them states near them great Michigan lakes
And fuck a bathroom, I pissed on the gate
Flipped the bird at em, flip a bird, switch up my plates
I got plans that was better than jail
Now look -- we like Bird, Parish, Kevin McHale
Scott, Worthy, Jabbar, and Magic
Oh my god it's magic; Isiah, Dumars, I will carve your casket
Phil, Scottie, and Mike; Phil, Shaq, and Kobe
My gats will detach you, homie
And I'm friends with thugs, I sell endless drugs
For the Roc Fam, dog, I extend my love
Jay, Bleek, beef I'll be crossing the bridge
Tossing they wigs, make corpse of they kids
Free, O, Sparks, and Mack Mittens
I'm 95 south, no doubt, mac clip in
I stack chips and I'm Saks Fifth-in
Louis Vuitton loafers, hat dripping
I go retrieve a duck, tell her proceed and suck
I don't just beat my cases, I beat 'em up
My lawyer eat 'em up put bars behind me
I'm glad they didn't stop that car behind me
Shit, it had three felons, gun shooters no
50 cal. A.C.P., Bazooka Joe
Don't be stupid though, I get scrilla man
I'm for'rilla man, yeah it's Killa Cam
Uhhh... DIP SET BITCH!

[Dame Dash]
What y'all thought I was finished?
I'm not! I just recuited somebody new!
I'm like the George Steinbrenner of this shit
I mean I'm rich like him, HOLLA!

[Twista]
Everybody's swarming, oh my god
It's the newest power forward of the squad
A legacy like Jordan with the mob
That be known for breaking motherfuckers hard
Put Roc-A-Fella on my pinky ring
Fuck a battle, nigga -- I'mma get them thangs
Rollin with them Lords and them folks up out the Chi
Twista gone make em spit the game
I represent the mob to the fullest
You don't want it with that boy who's known to pull it
With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm fin' to be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Taking it to some motherfuckers domes
Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Filling my body with lead, clutching chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest
I be more provoking when I'm smoking sess
And we getting stronger, hope you got a vest
Already got them Macs, already got them Tecs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearls
Legendary we on top of the world
How could you haters think we can be done
Hold it down because we got champions!!









[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin', Matt Lauer, can I live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
It's a nightmare, yeah
I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Baselin' the bezel
Your bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal
Lower level's where you settle at
I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
Where there's no brake pedals at
Between God and where the Devil's at
Had to double dutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
Exactly what the game's been missin'
This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen, Push

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Rick Ross]
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
This for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters
'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
From Honda Accords to Grammy awards
Dat's where the kings go

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I can blow a million dollars into dust
Lord knows how many bottles I've done bust
Still runnin' through the models like I'm Puff
Confront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff
Pusha know these politics is paradox
Chillin' in a condo full of ready rock
My homie amputated, but gon' stand for somethin'
I'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it (Maybach Music)
Watchin' my success for some is bittersweet
Always keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked
Diamonds drippin' on me via Tiffany's
All these K-9 units still sniffin' me
Ignorance versus the innocence
It's not the temperature for you in Timberlands
I keep the coldest flows on the hot seat
And you can spot my hoes by their car keys
Another episode full of atrocities
It's double M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)
You scared to see my face in a fancy place
So I debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace
It's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck
Still hands on, sucker, press your luck
Your money gone every other month
My money long so the treasure's tucked

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
That's where the kings go




[Chorus: Amnesty]
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on

Lift yourself up on your feet

[Chorus: Amnesty]
Lift your- lift your-, lift yourself
Lift-lift your-, lift your-, lift your-, lift your-, lift-lift

[Interlude: Kanye West & Amnesty]
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay
But they don't really realize, though
Said we need to strive for more liberty
This next verse, this next verse though
Lift yourself up on your feet
These bars
Lift yourself up on your feet
Watch this, go

Sorry the drink had me wildin' a little bit
But my link had me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna hit the island in a bit

Young Halle told me, "Make me feel good"
So I gave her the Monster Balls

[Verse 5: Consequence]
So don't be shy baby pick a handbag
And the shoes to match that'll really get them mad
And don't worry about it cause I'm picking up the tab
Cause nothing gets the girls like a little bit of cash
Or whatever they want

[Hook: John Legend]
Hey girl, we gon live it up tonight
Hey girl, welcome to the Grammy life
Hey girl, you know hows this goes
Doesn't get old, centerfold
Is all I know
Whatever you want

[Outro: John Legend]
La la la la la la
La la la la
Whatever you want
La la la la la la
La la la la




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

[Hook: Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook: Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Outro: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond




[Intro]
How's your son? (all the things)
He made the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(...all all that glitters is not gold
And all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?
That's a new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo
Of your granny's picture, now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

[Chorus]
And I don't care 'bout
(all the diamond rings all the diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
(all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things
(real is what you lease on me)

[Verse 2]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit 3 in the bed if it's 6 of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

[Bridge]
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

[Chorus]
(All all all the diamond rings diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
(All all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
They don't mean a thing a thing
(All, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing a thing a thing
I don't care what they don't mean a thing
(All, all, all the things) all these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
All I know, I know all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things

[Outro]
CLK Mercedes Benz
All these things, all these things ...
All these things, all these things ...
All these things, all these things ...
A whole lotta money
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things
Mommy and Daddy, will you please stop fighting?
All these things, all these things
All these things, (and I don't care why) all these things
All these things, all these things
All these things, all these things...
Let's get Stevie outta jail




[Intro: Samoria Green & Natalie Green]
(Yes, God)
We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord)
We want the lord (Yes, Jesus)
And that's it (Yes, God)

[Chorus: Kanye West & The-Dream]
I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Verse 1: Kanye West & The-Dream]
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
That's why we need you now, oh
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is a God dream

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream

[Refrain: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir, Natalie Greene]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, here's an impromptu, I want you
I'm goin' to tell you what I want to - do to you
Your girlfriend, she wants to - beautiful
Just flew in from Paris - voulez-vous?
In the city that don't snooze
Smooze amongst the Who's Whos
And I use my celeb to get this one home
Why everything that feel so good gotta be so wrong?
Gimme room now, I'm like a vampire on the full moon now
And I don't know about you now
But I think I wanna try sumthin' new now
See what it do now
And when you sat down
Uh, 'cause you was losing yo' breath now
Uh, 'cause you be doing it to def now
She be doin E to F now, what's left now?
Mr. West now, can you get any more fresh now?
I think I just did, just now
Talkin' my shit, that's how

Flashing Lights show, I live that
Fame is a drug, wanna hit that?
'Cause they know exactly where to get that - did you get that?

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Life is like a long love song so I vibe
Yellow brick road on 24's as I ride
Shorty is a winner, when I'm in her I get lost
Make her tremble like the middle of December on the frost
UGG boots in a coupe dual exhaust
As I fall deep in love, Mr. West check my pulse
Paintings on the wall, Basquiat is her favorite
Black Maybach way trilla than a slave ship
How can I not spazz, questions that I'm asked
Home owner at nineteen, yo I done learned fast
My first love cheated on me, she was heartless
She fucked the quarterback and seperated partners
I took my quarter back and played another cartridge
I took my locket back and threw it in the garbage
I sang a melody, it sounded nice as T-Pain's
Okay I'm playing follow me, just to peep game
We party hard and fall asleep on the airplane
If she flirty in the dirty, then she fair game
Checkerboard luggage as they holler all aboard!
Portishead in the iPod until I reach a snore
In the clouds of the lear, thinking of Shakir
Run the game like my nigga still was here
In the clouds of the lear thinking of Shakir
We run the game like my nigga here, Baous

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight into the night

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?




[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

[Refrain: Pusha T]
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (wooo!)
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (wooo!)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (wooo!)
Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces

[Refrain: Pusha T]
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these motherfuckers hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload

[Refrain: Pusha T]
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it




[Verse 1]
They boarded up my favorite bar
The Frenchman lost his restaurant
And the secret alleys were rearranged
I woke one day and it had changed

[Chorus]
My city's gone
My city's gone
Feeling lost in inevitable

[Verse 2]
On forty-three, my heart once beat
On forty-five, I came alive
And there was a spirit, so young and free
It spoke to you, it spoke to me

[Chorus: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
My city's gone (My city, oh oh)
Oh no, my city's gone (My city's gone)
Feeling lost in inevitable

[Verse 3]
I met a man who coughed and swore
That it had been changing since it was born
That it was I and nothing more
From twenty-three to thirty-four

[Chorus]
My city's gone
My city's gone
And I have to go
My city's gone

[Outro]
I still found me back in the mall
I will not decline
Still feeling lost and nothing more
I feel lost in time
Does anybody happen to know (Happen to know)
Way after I'm
Still feeling lost and manageable
I say nothing's right
Tell it all from the heart
I'm sitting out at the bar
Tell it all that I'm making my way




[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, "Trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, "You won't leave me if you love me"
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, "The end, question mark"

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Hook: Mos Def & Kanye West]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Hook: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean "me go?" Why can't it be "we go"?
What happens when people turn to tears? (huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
(Do it!) How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying "The world did this to me"
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your "Seans, you know I love you"
Shedding tears everyday (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Why?" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial




[Intro]
This a classic, just add this to the rest of them

[Chorus: Mase, (Kanye West) & John Legend]
See, I know what y'all like (Yeah)
That's why it's gon' be alright (Turn me up)
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
(If y'all could feel how my face felt, you would know how Ma$e felt)
See I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright (Come on, I hear John Legend)
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
<>Ooh<>
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mase said come on, Mike said shamone
Let's start it up early like Raven Symone
Keisha Knight Pull, Emanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothing handed at all, but did I complain
Every time magazines tried to taint mine name
But y'all can't hold me down like restraint
I took the "t" up out the word can't
Around the same time Nas said I can
Bush was sending our fam' to Iran
I'm in the club with Henny, ass in my other hand
Lord, please forgive me I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
'Fore they do me like they did Janet adjusting them
Me and my cousin them, trying to rap like Busta and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't never ever accept no money
From these so-called sponsors
They was in Benzs, I was in Hondas
Now I'm wondering where they all at like a nonda
Hmm, that's something to ponder
The money y'all make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you
You the next, I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it some decibels
And put some more zeros in front of that decimal, nigga!

[Chorus: Mase]
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Arm froze and all, Dom Rose and all
Maserati, Bugatti, the roads and all
Different color Louis open toes and all
I tried to tell the chicks don't expose it all
Country dude's mouth full of golds and all
Bay area chicks, cornrows and all
I do it right I do my wife, I leave the hoes to y'all
Close the boutique, I might close the mall
I jerk my [?] in Turks and Caicos
I wave the Rollie you wave the Seiko
Need I say more, more diamonds than LisaRaye
I'm no replica, I am the DNA
Breeze through leave you like the  hurricane
Somebody get killed the whole borough blamed
M-A dollar what a thorough name
No matter who come through I'm forever the king
I should've never left the game its what a kiddie say
Still, chicks throwing me up like newlyweds
I'm grown and sexy done with groupie head
In the milk-white Phantom, the seats are ruby red
You hear the rumor listen to the facts
I drive my cars in pairs like pity pat
When I drop the track it feel like Biggie back
The game is country I came to bring the city
I came, I came to bring the city back

[Chorus: Mase]
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

[Outro: Mase]
For real, put your hands up
G.O.O.D. Music, put your hands up
Bad Boy, put your hands up
Roc-A-Fella, put your hands up
Chi-Town, put your hands up
NY, put your hands up
Miami, put your hands up
Texas, put your hands up
Tennessee, put your hands up
London, put your hands up
Japan, put your hands up
All around the world, all around the world
LA, put your hands up
ATL, put your hands up
Man, this gon' be...




[Intro: Kanye West]
Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Every-everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?

[Hook 1: Kanye West]
Niggas reppin' the 'Go, but we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, nigga, we can't tell
You claim you got dough but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Politics kept me at the end of the mixtapes
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight (Uh-huh)
I'm trying to do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got B.I.G
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
That's the poison, that runs through their veins
And attacks they soul and just start to tear 'em up
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut ("Where you goin'?")
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing
(I ain't playing with y'all niggas)
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats himself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own (Uh-huh)
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
Y'all bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas getting dough, dawg, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s on a two-for-one sale

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I cop Ides by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'ma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'ma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, the Flic' , and Do or Die (What up!)
So first of all who am I? (The fuck is you?)
My-my-my name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now, I don't know if it's me
Or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so live/smooth, there's nothing to prove (Ooh-OOH!)

[Hook 3: Kanye West]
You niggas 'bout blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas gettin' dough, dawg, we can't tell
You copped one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

[Outro: Kanye West]
Everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Every-everywhere I go I'm a star, I'm a star
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, G.O.O.D. Music
Starshell in the house
Let me see what the fuck you're about
Hey ladies!
Sup, I'm tryin' to take that down
Hey ladies!
Sup, I'm tryin' to take that down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Want money like Jay, clothes like Ye
Chicks like Seal, mass appeal
I'm just tryin' to feel if the ass is real
Man I should've known since she from Brazil
South side, my nigga, give me room now
Money high, yeah my pockets on shrooms now
I had a lot of bullshit I had to tune out
It's me and dude now, what you gon' do now?
Cause if you mess with the scrubs, then you gon' do the dishes
I ain't Flavor Flav, but you look delicious
And your heels vicious, killin' these bitches
I'm so sin-seriously pimpin!

[Verse 2: Starshell]
Highlights and designer blues
With my tattoos of, "I love you"
I just threw on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you
I'm livin' it up
Secretly he notices how I'm playin' it up
For him, playin' it up
I'm livin' it up
Dancing on the tables as the DJ spinnin' it up
For me, spinnin' it up
For me, for me, for me, for me

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I do it, do it
Do it, do it, boy, boy, boy
B-I-G, okay show him you're a big girl
I'll show you why they call me big girl
I know you're tryin' to be my baby
But that mean I gotta lay you in the crib girl
Wobbledy-wobbledy wo-wobble wobble
I'm stack-stackin' my paper, my wallet look like a Bible
I got girlies half naked, that shit just look like the Grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal?
Like how you do that shit is not for real
Do it like you probably will
Okay, what you got is magic baby
So you gotta let me cop a feel, okay
Gon' touch your toesies, woahdie
Don't stop, keep going going going like my rollie
I might fuck around and put a tip on it
Fuck that, I'mma put my dick on it like woah

[Hook: Starshell]
Back to the beat, get up on your feet
Wanna be your superluva
Right back to the beat, get up on your feet
I'mma be your superluva
Wanna be your superluva

[Outro: Starshell]
Got 'em all sayin', "Hey hey hey"
Look at them, "Hey hey hey"
Look at them, "Hey hey hey"
Look at them, "Hey hey hey"
Got 'em all sayin'




God! God! God! God! God!

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Welcome to your life
Diamond through the light
This Miami vice
It's that life (okay, okay)
Dodging bullets in the air when (okay, okay)
There's cameras everywhere (okay, okay)
You don't know how to act right
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Travis Scott]
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gon' come to kill King Kong (skrrrrt, straight up)
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (straight up)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & Travis Scott]
Actin' on your worst behavior
Turn your back on all your haters
Everybody wants to rule the
Everybody wants to rule the world (straight up)
The world (straight up)

[Refrain: Kanye West]
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Everybody
Everybody

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
Everybody wants to rule the world
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
The world, the world, the world
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
The world, the world, the world
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb ,bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action-action
Ready-ready for action

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain: Kanye West]
So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Interlude: Kanye West & Travis Scott]
God

God

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Everybody wanna rule it
Get inside it, why they do it
Everybody, ride a little bit
Everybody, body do it
Do it
Do it




[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
Listen
You may see me in cars and clothes
But all this money can't make me happy
See this life ain't all I know
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
I guess you suppose
That all this money can make you happy
So I just want you to know
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Now I would wish you the best
And I would wish you success
But I would never want to wish you my stress
These haters would love to see holes through my tissue and flesh
And I assume if they miss you, you blessed
And the pretty women don't even want to kiss you unless
You in a Mitchell & Ness
Or you push through the best
But when I speak I make sure every issue's addressed
Before they twist you and mess
And try to diss you in press
And most cops want to frisk you I guess
They figure rap stars always move with the pistol and vest
Listen
It ain't easy as it looks with me
Some execs is as greasy as the crooks would be
Some women are as sleezy as the hookers be
And how I'm supposed to do right with with so much wrong around me
Get rid of the weak
And keep the strong around me
Everybody who come along belong around me you know

[Hook]

[Violin Solo: Miri Ben-Ari]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Kanye to the
I ask God to help me fly away
And if not
Then please keep your eye on me
These niggas is bringing out the worst side of me
When you wired me
You inspired me
To become the higher me
These execs
All want the details
How I made the world bounce like
Full messages on e-mails
But they hiding something like she-males
So
We still
Pull up in Sprewells
The ice and me chill
Like Goldmember, I love gold
What's the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I don't rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jackson's
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind

[Hook][x2]

[Intro]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Please stop your crying

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Verse 1]
Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh
Stop your cryin', baby

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Verse 2]
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right), that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?
"I'll be there in five minutes," go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah




Will.i.am:
We start that stuff that then become cool
We start them trends that then become rulez
Leavin' stickers on hat that your kids wear to school

Kenny:
Kenny West, teeth Crest
Came up from the gutter
Never fooled by Fabio, I can't believe its not butter

Bruno:
Low in cholesterol, yeah

Kenny:
Don't hear what we're sayin'? Just ask some white teens
Where you think they got the shutter shades and tight jeans?

Will.i.am:
And we're up in this club with more secrets than Free Masons
Never have to pay for beats because we always free basin'
Movin' in silence that's how the crew goes
Runnin' this like a snotty nose

Nicki:
Gonna need a tissue

Will.i.am:
Disappear like the career of Kevin Costner
While we're sittin' here drinkin' beer with Jimmy Hoffa

Kenny:
That's my eyeball looking at you from the pyramid on cash
We're so bad we can make an iPad run Flash
Got more secrets than deodorant
Bitch, we don't perspire
We're uncredited consultants on HBO's "The Wire"

Bruno:
Mmmnnn, once again
I love the Bubbles, de-de-de

Will.i.am:
Yeah, we start that stuff that then become cool
We start them trends that then become rulez
We're the first one to wait thirty minutes before swimming in the pool

All:
Illuminati starts shit that then becomes cool
Illuminati starts the trends that then becomes rulez
Illuminati!




Ayo
Planes, trains, automobiles
The G500s with the auto-roll wheels
Pinot Grigio, got 'em on chill
See now, see me ho? I got that deal
If you tryna build, I bet you'd like to know that
My father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt
And back in college, I ain't run with no frat
I just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children

Hold up, I'm fuckin' up the rap

Every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children
Put my hoodie on, blend in like a chameleon
Hear barbershop talk, niggas try to kill him
Take my hoodie off, they like "Ye waddup, you chillin'!"
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween minus the costumes
The niggas that's flickin' was the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' was the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationship, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans that's most recent
Now I throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent
Just to get pulled over by the precinct, so frequent
It's like I'm back bein' a delinquent
They wanna know where I live, stay, and work
Why a young black nigga get all these perks
How I stack my paper, got Adidas in every flavor
Excuse me officer, I don't know Rod Laver
Or Stan Smith, what they don't understand is
How I got that color in canvas




[Verse 1: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey…and clap for him…




[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I’m so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin’ forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I’m so reborn, I’m movin' forward
Keep movin’ forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin’ forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
(Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward)
Movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Something was wrong (Keep movin' forward)
Couldn't hold on, why? (Keep movin' forward)
So long (Keep movin' forward)
Sit here in this storm (Keep movin' forward)
Time goes on (Keep movin' forward)
Really couldn't find my way out (Keep movin' forward)
Of the storm (Keep movin' forward)
Which way do I go?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward




[T.I. - talking]
Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just sayin though

[Verse 1]
Ay look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplyin' the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand thats how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people misrepresenting my domain
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
For no gain (picture that)

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and on the creep
So you ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doin'?)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion
You hear us talking loud, just think of us as chameleons
Adapting to situations, but accusations of stealing
And burglarizing your house, I mean you just hurting my feelings
We got lives, we wanna live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are few, it's hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
When you're under 25, staying alive's hard work

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

[Verse 3]
And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law and busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even be fucking with y'all (maan)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Always stuck in the grind, summertime to wintertime
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job




There's gonna be some shit you might not understand
But, you may have to rewind this shit a few times
Heaven, heaven
Check it out

I know tomorrow ain't a promise
That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying "Back in the days..."
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying

(Chorus)
My angel
My sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend
My good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl

Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
Probably saying I'm the hypocrite, for judging these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody, hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon' change your life when you hear it
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven...)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't working
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven...
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expecting our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other motherfuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Instead of penitentiaries, we gon' need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?
Waitin' on a message from the reverend
And he ain't but another man, tryin' to get to (heaven...)




[Verse 1]
Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

[Hook]
It's your world

[Verse 2]
Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

[Hook]
It's your world

Kids
I wanna be a pediatrician
I wanna be a governor
I want to be a artist
I wanna be a veterinarian
I wanna be a model
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be a ballet dancer
I wanna be a football player
I wanna be a astronaut
I wanna be a obstetrician
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be a nurse
I wanna be a fashion designer
I want to be a gym teacher
I wanna be a architect
I want to be a duck
I wanna be a wrestler
I wanna be a dancer
I wanna be the first African-American female president
I wanna be a police officer
I wanna be a rock star
I wanna be a gymnastics teacher
I wanna be a captain of a police station
I wanna be a drummer
I wanna be an actress
I wanna be a superstar

[POPS]
Be, be here, be there, be that, be this
Be grateful for life, be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000
Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie
Be little black Sambo with bad hair
Be aware of Willie Lynch-ism
Be, be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I
Be a strong academic student, be an A student in Sociology
Be food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice at any rate
Be high when you low, be on time but know when to go
Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin
A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartographer
A map maker, be able to find Afro-American land
Search thoroughly, it may be close to black land
Be amended 5/5ths, be amended 5/5ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house
Be... eternal




[Verse 1]
It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Hook]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing (x2)
It's amazing

[Verse 2]
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Hook]

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing

No matter what, you’ll never take that from me
My reign is as far…
Bring it back down though

It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
Never take that from me

No take it back down, take it back, keep going

It feels like you're on trial sometimes
And in a relationship, you can also be on trial
And be convicted with no jury

And this song was sort of like that moment where someone tells you ain't, you ain’t - you gotta say I am - an emancipation, if you will
Cause you can't take that from me
My self-esteem

So whether it something in your own home, or a situation like mine
Where you're under the microscope of the media

Never let them take that from you
I never let them, let them take that from me

You have to be amazing sometimes
I and I know I do not always state popular opinion

Amazing, Michael Jackson, amazing
Michael Phelps, amazing
OJ Simpson, amazing
Is he not?!
What he did when he did what he did, was he not amazing though?

I think I saw in a movie - I get my quotes from movies cause I don't read
Or from like, go figure, real life or something
Like live real live, talk to real people, get information, ask people, questions
And it was something about, you either die a superhero or you live to become the villain
I'M CHILLIN'

*Kanye chicken noise*

I'm chillin'

So many times they try to make me out to be the villain
I don't understand what I did
I apologize for acting like a bitch at award-shows
It's an award-show, didn't kill anyone
But yet and still I apologize for my ungraciousness

I was a spoiled little Chicago-boy, who got all these awards as he came in the door and people clapped and sang his praises
And he soaked it all up and believed his own hype
To the point where he could not lose
And if anyone didn't pick him, they could not choose
As he swooves with the who's-who's and broke all the rules
And even lost his cool
Hey, nothing new
Now they don't like you, hey they don't like you
Look at what you've done boy, trying to be the number one boy

And I'm thirty-one years now and I've leaned from my mistakes

Just play pianos...

Super-hero music, pain

This hardcore, so hardcore
That's why I sing:

I'm a monster, I'm maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave up, never gave in
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing




[Verse 1]
Sixteen, already push the Range Rove
My CEO made the whole world change clothes
Now we got the whole hood riding skateboards
Doin; tricks like (oh oh oh)
Yep antiques, Y-3's, and them ice-cream's, uh-oh, uh-oh, yeah
I think they like me cause I'm so on fly like the birds be
You didn't heard me?
I keep the beat bump-bumpin 'til your head hurt
Keep your back jerking, now, that's hard work
Just remember, baby, where you heard it first
And that's right here, they heard this record
And they thought I gone postal, well, I'm loco
You know so, I'm global, you local, come on now

[Chorus]
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, just a little swag to it
It's got a swag, badaboom, badabing
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, just a little swag to it
It's got a swag, badaboom, badabing

[Verse 2]
You ain't even gotta ask, I ain't even gotta brag
Once a week in the mall, spending money
Poppin' tags, tying rags around our neck, yeah, I'm bad
You know what's next, billionaire babe's clothes (oh, oh, oh)
Got my Vans on and they look like vans
Canaries in my ear to match what's on my hand
Graffiti on the wall, y'all better understand
Said y'all better understand
When they hear me, they be like, "yeah, me too"
That's why I call them other broads "Ms. Me Too"
'Cause they don't skateboard through the city like we do
We move, breeze through, like
Preferably I be dressed better than all your broads
Fresher than everybody, (yes sir) 'cause I'm a trendsetter
I'm known for spending cheddar, you hating on me?
Never, ever, ever

[Chorus]
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, just a little swag to it
It's got a swag, badaboom, badabing
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, kinda got a swag to it
It's got a swag to it, just a little swag to it
It's got a swag, badaboom, badabing




[Intro: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Coachella, if you havin' a good time tonight, make some noise
Give it up for Hova

[Verse 1: JAY-Z & & Beyoncé]
Come on
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag Bey, boy, you hurtin’ that
Brooklyn Baby where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and Bey, she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Baby (Yeah), seem like everywhere I go, I see you (Yeah)
From your eyes your smile, it's like I breathe you (That's right)
Helplessly, I reminisce, don’t want to (Uh huh)
Compare nobody to you (Take 'em uptown)

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control (Take 'em uptown)
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go (Let's go)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Know that I can't get over you (Hey, uh)
'Cause everything I see is you (Oh whoa, that’s right)
And I don’t want no substitute (That's right)
Baby, I swear it’s déjà vu (Come on)
Know that I can't get over you (Uh huh)
'Cause everything I see is you (Uh huh)
And I don't want no substitute (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I swear it’s déjà vu

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yeah, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need the help tryna study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
It's a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true (Yeah)
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having déjà vu?

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute (Here we go)
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Outro]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light




[Intro: Ken Kaniff]
Uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home beating my shit to death
I'm listening to The Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff and I'm still mad as hell
Fuck you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm crazy with this razor, with this razor, I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed, I'm crazy!
(Okay, I'm reloaded) Go bring Jay-Z!
(Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him) On Dre's beats
Ran in the ladies' room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (ahh)
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank at the clerk
And handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
Nut I didn't take nothing (thanks)
Every bullet came from the same gun, just from different angles
Cause I was picking strange places to aim from
(Man, I bet you fifty bucks you won't jump out the window, Shady)
*Crash* (Ahhhh!!) pay me

[Verse 2: The Madd Rapper]
Psyche! No bread, fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed
(Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy motherfucker, might shoot me a Fed
Or I just might start a fistfight instead
See as far as the dough go, I go loco
See me pumpin' gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro, mixed with cocoa
Jump turn styles, then run from po-po

[Hook: The Madd Rapper & Eminem]
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy!
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy!

[Verse 3: The Madd Rapper]
Yo, yo, I wish I'd been aborted, my pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss, I can't afford it
I'm trying to sell a O, my pops trying to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my Rottweiler still shits on the rugs (Goddammit Spike)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like
(Eh.... Oh... Dude
Yo, this shit is crazy... oohhhh..... This is incredible... ohhh....)
Fuck that, Slim, keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help
Word!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got a beautiful wife, kids, and a gorgeous home
What would make me jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight vicious, I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you with eight stitches
What, I'm gay, cause I hate bitches?
Slut, don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And I'll still be mad at the world even if it apologized to me (sorry)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man
About to blow his fucking brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse
On top of his spouse, spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturing Michael Jackson
In little boys' drawers shopping at toy stores
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it (Yeraraer!)
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fucking pill mom, don't vacuum

[Hook: The Madd Rapper & Eminem]
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd Rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is crazy




[Intro: Raekwon]
Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, "You lookin' good, fly colored Asian"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this (bitch), the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

It’s been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing…

I guess in a media world where you never hear the truth, the truth can come off as crazy…

Thank you to @asvpxrocky for supporting me at the MSG show…

Together we stand… we win…

The future thinkers win…

The artists win...

The thinkers win…

The pure of heart win…

We win

Get Top on the phoooone!!!!!  @Kendricklamar




[Intro: Liz Vice]
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
Let Your blessings from above fill me with that precious love
There's a Li–

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Thought I could beat Em in a battle a year ago
When he dropped that album I was thinking about for a year or so
Then Ye dropped, I know my timeline is fucked up
If Drizzy don't fuck with shoes, then don't wear 'em, the fuck bruh
Nigga acting he fucked Kim K, the fuck bruh
If I see him I won't pop, I'll just say the fuck bruh
Nigga want Cancer, want smoke, want puff bruh
Now a nigga tryna box, Does he think that he buff bruh
I'm basically B. Simmons, I don't shoot
I'll just throw that nigga down a fucking trash shoot
I like trap producers but not the ones that use flutes
You think you the pied piper or some shit ooh
I need to take some pills right now
They prescription
When I first the family I thought they was Egyptian
Then I did my research, Look at the fucking description
Armenian with a big booty, damn this bitch so gifted

[Bridge: Liz Vice]
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
Let Your blessings from above fill me with that precious love
There's a Light in my life shining over me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi and Liz Vice]
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
Let Your blessings from above fill me with that precious love

1[Verse 2: Desiigner]
Whole 7-seater and I'm driving through the hood
They said I wouldn't understand but I understood
Dope smoking on the corner
Nobody ever warned us
Sometimes I wonder
How it feels to be Stevie Wonder
How it feels to be Tom Brady
How it feels to be Tracy McGrady
Now a lil nigga might wonder
How it feels to be Desiigner
How it feels to be Kanye West
How it feels to have an arrest
How a damn chain feels on their neck
How it feels to put wood in some breasts
How it feels to be treated like pests
They already know about the last one
Don't try to tell me the 12 trying they best

[Bridge: Liz Vice]
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
Let Your blessings from above fill me with that precious love
There's a Light in my life shining over me

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm a King eating a cupcake
Like Lebron eating KD
Damn why the vibe so wavy
Damn she tryna have another baby
The media wanna know about the names though
Why I named my girl Chicago
Well why did Jah call him Gekyume
Why did Breezy call him royal
Nigga we famous we do what we want
Catch a nigga in the rain like I'm Ebron
All these niggas so Emo
Yo that verse kinda sound familiar
Free 6ix9ine man for real though

[Bridge: Liz Vice]
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
Let Your blessings from above fill me with that precious love
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
There's a Light in my life shining over me
Let Your blessings from above fill me with that precious love
There's a Light in my life shining over me




[Intro: Jay-Z]
Haters, haters; these niggas is haters
And I made myself so easy to love

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How much they hate it? very!
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung, but I Spring 'er, Jerry
Don’t try this at home: results may vary
King like T.I., but in the Chi, Larry...

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Hoover, Hova
Both are American Gangsters
You choose who's colder
Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser
I can’t even stomach myself, ulcer!
More realer 'cause I'm closer
Had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
Poser, no sir
My hustle, so Russell, I stretch work, yoga
You know I got it down, dog
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain’t nothing for me to knock some nouns off
At these MCs praying for my downfall
They just haters, I wave at you, I’m so player
I’ll never be done, I’m so rare

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
We killing the game, it's not fair
You muh'fuckers stay right there
'Cause we too high up in the air
We blasting off just like a laser
Nigga, pee-une, pee-une, pee-une
Get back, gimme room room room
DB9 like vroom, vroom, vroom
Young Hov', what we doin', doin', doin'?

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
We ballin', bitches
Eating y'all food, leaving dishes
Why these niggas always talking Lear talk, 'Ye?
Why I never see 'em at the Clearport, 'Ye?
Why always hear they at the airport?
While I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force?
Therefore, please stop talking my ears off
Millionaire talk
You haters, you mad at me 'cause your paper
Need to get its motherfucking weight up
Hold up, wait up, I ain’t done
Name one thing I ain’t done
It hurts when you say that I ain't the one
You haters, how do I gain your favor?
I need to know 'cause I care
I need you to love me, I swear, look here!
See 'Ye is running the Chi like Gale Sayers
I'm running New York, I got the mayor on my pager
You can’t fade us, you haters
I need you, stay there, I breathe you like air
Yeah-yuh, yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yuh




[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 1]
Yo, I used to dribble the rock down the block in '94
Shoot the courts out when Killer Wayne brought that Porsche out
I had the illest jump shot so he bet all his money on me
12 years old with the hunnies on me
Patrick Ewings on, I kept the fresh kicks
Take a nigga out his Jordan's if the motherfuckers fit (they fit)
They fit so I'm back up the block
Fuckin' with the homies tryin' to teach them how to slap box
In front of the crack spot fiends fightin' over crack rock
Dimes the size of golf balls, yeah, them shits was that hot
He had them black Locs on like MC Ren
And Deebo came through in the hood in that coke-white Benz
Before 106 & Park and 24 inch rims
Before these corny niggas kept the stickers under they brims
It was a little nigga in Compton, five foot ten
He was dope as a motherfucker, I wanted to be like him

[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I ain't gon' lie, homie I used to do the Hammer Dance
Make it worse, I had steel toes on and hammer pants
Fucked up right? That's when my pops had the weight
He had to blow while I was blowin' in Nintendo tapes
Got my ass whooped for takin' the Duck Hunt gun outside
In my window watchin' all the kids have fun outside
Ice cream truck makin' noise, I want to run outside
But I'ma get my ass whooped again if I run outside
Swear I was on punishment until my tenth grade year
This new girl move on the block, light skin with wavy hair
I asked her did she want to hump me, she was like, "I don't care"
So I took off her training bra, that's when she got scared
She wanted me to be her boyfriend, so I was like, "Yeah"
I'm tryin' to think of LL lines in the back of my head
"When I'm alone in my room" I can't remember what he said
But I know Uncle Luke, bitch give me some head
It go..

[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 3]
Shit, I'm grown now pops in jail, I'm on my own now
Got my first kilo and my brick phone now
Two door Cutlass, sittin' on that chrome now
Headed to the county jail, two T's comin' home now
Yeah, homie, shit changed, nigga's don't bang like they used to
And I can't dunk like I used to, niggas don't move fast enough When they hear the *WOO WOOP*
And takin' fades is played out like Fubu
I got a TV in the dash watchin' Friday
21, no felon, tell them niggas, crime pay
Red rag in my pocket, doin' it my way
Two switches, so the cutlass bounce sideways
Four amps, 15s beatin' the trunk
Try to jack me for my shit? Gotta beat me to the pump, punk
I'm on my gangsta shit nigga wit' a attitude
On my motherfuckin' gangsta shit

[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Outro]
Hey Lo, I'm a take these nigga's back man
Back to the number 4 Jordans, nigga, them shits were sway
Remember those motherfuckas? Had the number 4 Jordans, man
When the new shits got old, we couldn't afford the new ones, man
So we went to motherfuckin' Payless and got that black shoe polish
Put so much shoe polish on them motherfuckas tryin' to keep them shiny black that them motherfuckas turned leather!
Or like when the motherfuckin' ice cream nigga came through
I remember the nigga name, it was Hector, man
And he would come through in the ice cream truck
And got all the motherfuckin' stickers on the ice cream truck
Like he just ballin' crazy out the game
This nigga got stickers of motherfuckin' ice cream sandwiches
Strawberry short cakes, UFOs, motherfuckin' big sticks
Then you ask this nigga do he got any of them motherfucka's he talkin' about
All he got is Now & Laters
What the fuck you in an ice cream truck for then, Hector?
Get the fuck out of here, man
Shit, look at these niggas now man all these funny clothes and jackets and all fuckin' little..
This lookin' fuckin' crazy, man
I'mma keep it gangsta on these niggas yo
Nigga's can't fuck with me, man, I'm a on that motherfuckin' 1990
Straight Outta Compton express Yourself
Eazy E jerry curl drippin'
MC Ren, black loc straight out the swap meet
Dr. Dre black Khaki's black tee shirt
Motherfuckin' gold rope around my neck
DJ Yella Raider motherfuckin' hat to the back
Ice Cube suck my motherfuckin' dick shit
Bitches

Can't be my baby with no maybes
Can't roll it down up with my lady
You know that all these niggas still crazy
Been two months since I talked to Jay-Z




[Intro]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of 'em coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go...

[Verse 1]
Every sunset feel righter, sunshines feel brighter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this, I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you noticed, them accident pictures is bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can
Drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I went before Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throwin' some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Out the blue girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident, they tellin' me that it's the cheeks
But if you look at history, the last rapper that almost died
Sold 6.5 'cept I'm comin' from the Chi

[Hook]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Hecky naw that boy is raw

[Verse 2]
Now even though I ain't wired up
We-we-we fired up
You ain't seen my concerts lately, they be linin' up
You ain't seen my girls lately, they be tryin' to cut
And they heard about my girl so I still chill
Cause Monica Lewinsky already killed Bill
And that girl that was with Kobe tried to go for the kill
I think he put it in the wrong Holyfield
Can I take a minute with y'all to be totally real?
Far as my jaw and all, it ain't totally heal
If I would have died, 10/23 of last year
That would have threw a monkey wrench in my whole career
But me, I took the worst thing, turn it into the best thing
I'm from the Chi, I guess it's just a Midwest thing
Times like this make life interesting
Times like this make me count my blessings
Cause you could run around like King of the Chi
But God could take that in a blink of a eye
I remember Cedars-Sinai and all those cryin'
Mama, I'm sorry for almost dyin'
Tell Alwe G and Hip Hop man
Tell Don I'ma John Monopolize the game
Add on Benny Medina, we gon' take 'em to the cleaners
I'm Kanye West, the college dropout slash genius

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now if the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Now keep 'em in the air
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We outta here
College Dropout




[Intro: Richard Pryor]
The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
"Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!"
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, "Ree, put your hands up, black boy!"

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

[Verse 1: Nas]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

[Chorus: Slick Rick & Kanye West]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (workin' nine-to-five)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (tryna stay alive)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (makin' ends meet)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (shot him this week)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream




[Intro]
Yeah, DC
Stand up for your boy Ka Ree
I go by the name of Kanye To The
The Roc is in the building
And as far as I'm concerned, we about to bring that real soul back to the game
John Legend on the backgrounds by the way
Let's go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghost’s style mixed with Mos' style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well?
Well, our father please forgive me
I'm sinner slash winner slash soul inventer

[Refrain]
It's so soulful man, it's so soulful man
So soulful man
And when you hear it is where it feels like soul food man
It was so soulful man
It's so soulful man, it's so soulful man
And right here is where it feels like soul food man

[Verse 2: Consequence]
Look my Mommy don't be playing cause she know I got my game in tact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
And chickens know I'm gonna do it how I wanna do it
And miss communication, no we never run into it
I got chicks like Simone and Cala
Stay with lip gloss and Fendi bag beside her
And your girl said you ain't ready for me
I'm in love so Mommy got me singing Tina Marie
How you bomb in Giovanni, she in Gucci and Prada
Chilling in a Mirada, studying like a scholar
So I don't even bother, I be popping my collar
I can get into your soul when I call you tomorrow
Come on

[Refrain]

[Bridge: John Legend]
I know you got a lot of stress today
Let's hit the party like we just got paid
And if you really want to get away
And say yeah, yeah
Got people on your back constantly
And you never get a second to breathe
You know you gotta get a way with me so say
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I'mma worry about the trade then ball then try and trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and invade the mall
You sore losers picked the wrong guy to take the fall
I probably trade in the fall what they made in the fall
Went from a never quite was to an overnight was
Cause the way I flip metaphor nobody quite does
By the time I leave the club, I'm wearing a public arms
Cause he must have been a pro the way see the pros and cons
They calling this the army
Money boys are we say jay b hopping down when I'm trying do my laundry
But I ain't even sorry for the way I get my dough
Cause J, Khayree and Kan got that food for your soul
[Refrain]




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wish all wack niggas'd get out the game
You can't con me, that’s half my name
And if you had any brains you wouldn't wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game
Wack nigga, the beat go, “Duh-duh-da”
And then your flow go way the fuck off
I kill y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
But I'm not trying to cause commotion
And have my niggas bring all the toast in
I just want your girl to rub my balls with lotion
'Cause you got madder, ripped down all my posters
But you came at me like "Yo, I got the Kia with the woodgrain"
Yeah you would, lame
"On the real, in the streets I got the good name
"I got the TV" Yeah, that’s good, man

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip your frame up
Asking if I'm nice, like fucking with a chick that don't give head
That's a no-brainer
Niggas pack bangers y'all don't even know the names of
I’m about to meet the quota, you about to meet the savior
Wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got
Word, not that I'm wilding or even promoting violence
It's just you fucking up my high, can't a nigga smoke in silence?
You wack niggas

[Hook: Kanye West & Talib Kweli]
Wake up in the morning, dawg, you just a wack niggas
I'd kill myself if I was that wack niggas
Everything you wear and rock is just wack niggas
Even if you flossing rocks, you just wack niggas
You can't do it, dawg, you's a wack niggas
Biting ass, bitch ass, trick ass wack niggas
Even your daughter says, "My Daddy's a–" wack niggas
You wack nigga!

[Bridge: Kanye West]
(In the beginning) Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got jungle fever
Black Benz, white truck and one two-seater
Wack niggas hold hands and follow the procedure
'Cause I got enough tools that one gon' leave you
If I drop enough dudes, man, one gon' reach you
If they build enough schools, man, one gon' teach you
Kanye the shit, but I ain't trying to be feces-tious

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge: Kanye West]

Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

[Verse 1]
Why you actin' all... shy and all?
Why is y'all... lyin' for?
"I never did this before..." Stop that
What, you want some Patron? I got that
I mean I promise y'all, you fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off

[Bridge]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it floooooow, oh, oh
Had some problems before
But see we let em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it bloooooow, oh, oh

[Hook]
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

[Verse 2]
See you know my style, I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me
Said, "Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was practicing
'Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal for my newborn child

[Hook]
'Cause now y'all know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

[Bridge]
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris' and some Mo'
And we about to let it floooooow, oh, oh
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that 'dro
And we about to let it bloooooow, oh

[Outro]
Oh, oh!
We lookin' for some hoes, hoes!
Ow!




[Intro: Blades of Glory sample]
“We're going to skate to one song, one song only”
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let’s get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Kanye West]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

[Verse 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all"
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it, Jay?
(Ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(Ball so hard) "Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I’m in France, ahah, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
‘Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga?
What’s Louis, my killer?
What’s drugs, my dealer?
What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
‘Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude: Blades of Glory sample]
“I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going”

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me

[Outro: Kanye West, JAY-Z & both]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin’ like the summer ain’t mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
(You know how many hot bitches I own?)
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I’m definitely in my zone, zone, zone, zone, zone...)

[Intro]
To my nigga
Who brought me in this world
Ha, that's right nigga

[Verse 1]
My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day, mama was either home
Or at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone peeping out the window heated
But still I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and mom's love

[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"

[Verse 2]
So many kids I knew, never knew who pop was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death
But stayed, watched me crawl 'til I took my first step
To the first grade, to my first fistfight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
"What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you're not my mommy!"
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand, "Little me
What's in you is inside me"

[Chorus]
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"

[Verse 3]
Uhh, my nigga
Pops told me hold my own
Pops told me value home
Could I help it poppa was a rolling stone?
Who loved the pretty brown round, outta town bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are the same now
No white lines, no trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that be pumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you kid
Life goes on...

[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

[Chorus]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Chorus]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AHH!
AHH!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit—I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
AHH!
AHH!
AHH!
AHH!

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god




[Intro: 6ix9ine & Baka]
Uh
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Tiki Taki, Spanish mami, she a hot tamale (Hot)
Make her spend that money, dummy, go retarded for me (Pop it)
Pop it, pop it, she get started, she won't ever stop it
Little thottie, thottarati choosin' everybody

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Splish, splash, Apple Bottoms make that ass fat
She got that wet wet, got me blowin' through this whole bag (Rack)
She got B's, spend some cheese, now they double D's
Thought I had to free, kick her out, my mama comin' home at three
Ho thicker-thicker-thicker than a fuckin' Snicker
Drug dealer, professional pot-whipper
In the winter, buy your ho a chinchilla (Grrr)
I just bought my bitch them Kylie Jenner lip fillers

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Man, oh my God
She Instagram famous but she can't keep a job (Ooh)
Man, oh my God
Swipe her 30-inch weave on her sugar daddy card (Ooh)
Man, oh my God
Her doctor got her bustin' out her motherfuckin' bra (Mmm)
Man, oh my God
She Uber to a nigga with no car

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Talkin' 'bout the relish, I do not embellish
Jacket got wings, True's got propellers
Gave all my old Margielas to my boy Marcellus
Pulled up with no laces, had the whole block jealous
Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't need advice
Wild nigga life, tell 'em read my rights
Man it hot tonight, lucky I wore my ice
15 in the game, baby girl, I got stripes (Huuh)

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Ka-Ka-Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, magic as I recall
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls (Chris Pauls)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I was out in Spain rockin' a Medusa head
I ain't never have to give a rap producer head
If I do, though, I'ma write a book like Supahead
This ain't wonder that I'm makin', this that super bread
Splish, splash, fuck him in a hurry, quick, fast
Still a pink wig, thick ass, whiplash
Got him cummin', cummin', Roger, over, dispatch
Said my box is the best, he met his match
I got all these bitches wantin' to be Barbie dolls
Barbie Dreamhouse, pink and purple marble walls
Pull-Pull up in that Barbie 'Rari, finna bury y'all
She threw dirt on my name, ended up at her own burial

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, magic as I recall
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls
Ka-Ka-Kanye dressed me up like a doll
Then I hit 6ix9ine, tell him give me the ball
Bitch, this the dream team, Fif' is on call
Whole squad on point, bunch of Chris Pauls (Chris Pauls)

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Tiki Taki, Spanish mami, she a hot tamale (Hot)
Make her spend that money, dummy, go retarded for me (Pop it)
Pop it, pop it, she get started, she won't ever stop it
Little thottie, thottarati choosin' everybody




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go
Take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make

[Verse 2: Drake]
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go L-A, V-A
N-Y, T-O
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazing'
Girls tryin' sell a whole lobby of us
Hear 'em all screaming then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make




[Intro]
Uh, chegamos até o ponto final da viagem. Acabou-se (Diamantes). Essa é pra ti. Essa aqui vai pra toda gente que me inspirou até agora. Esse álbum é pra vocês. (Que Deus vos abençoe) Vocês... são os meus Diamantes

[Verso 1]
Tu és beleza interior, á margem do igual
Ostentas com valor, a essência num cristal
Talhado á excelência do esmero do ser
Ter é secundário, priorizas o saber
És fonte de moral, sem tédio visual
A musa intemporal, de perfil escultural
Contemplo a espontaneidade
D'um sorriso que disserta excentridade
Que desperta e liberta na suavidade
Aroma que revela a identidade da capela de integridade
És vida, amizade, amor, verdade
És sol na tempestade, radias dignidade
A musa dos roteiros desafias teorias
Quando o mal te bate porta esquivas e regozijas
É um orgulho ser um pedaço teu
Pr’os momentos mais difíceis és um pedaço do céu (só meu)

[CORO]
"They long to be" (mas ninguém é como tu, mama, nah)
"They long to be" (mas ninguém é como tu, mama, nah)
"They long to be" (mas ninguém é como tu, mama, nah)
"I like to be your  bestfriend" (tu me inspiras... Diamante)

[Verso 2]
Mais que um espelho, tu refletes o que tu és
Rainha das Virtudes mas tu nunca ensoberbeces
A musica pra alma, sublime poesia
O verso pr'o instrumento que completa a melodia
És a luz no escuro, Diamante, meu lar
Fortaleza celestial como reunião familhar
Meu abrigo, me acolhes com apresso
Eu admiro com apreço, cá dentro agradeco
Tu és forte, digo certeza
És a frase que me escapa pra ressaltar tua grandeza
O mundo inveja, nunca vira nada igual
Pra constelação no céu, és a atriz primordial (no amor)
De coração, jamais ponderas
Amor incondicional, aurora das primaveras
Te Amo, és especial e fazes bem
És rara pura, dura, e não mudas por ninguém

[CORO]

[Outro]
Tu, minha fonte de inspiração
Onde bebo licções que geram motivação
Contigo aprendi que devo escrever de coração
Tu, a real definição
Exaltas em mim sinceridade
Criatividade, acima de tudo fidelidade
Me mostraste identidade, ultra mentalidade
Por ti sou diferente, suspiras positividade
Por ti sou verdadeiro e não porque convém
Sou seletivo, não me aproveito de ninguém
És avô, mãe, filha, prima (descansa em paz)
Tia ou neta, nem todo verso acaba em rima
Isso vai pra todos, man, CD tá terminado, vai pra toda minha familha, pr'os meus amigos, pra BRA´HooD (Fantasma)
Hey El, te devo muito do que sou
Isso vai dos meus avôs aos netos da Dona Dó

E de tudo... de tudo só restam os bons momentos... pelo menos é isso que guardo no meu peito porque esse CD é isso, são os bons momentos, reflexo do que é bonito, do que é positivo. E é isso que eu guardo...
E as lágrimas que jorraste, Deus recolhe

Diamantes

[Intro]
Yo

[Refrain]
They try to say Kanye West
Was out here wildin' like, uh, Delonte West
But these new verses sounding like Andre’s best
But he couldn't ever quite seem to get quite Andre fresh
Three stacks, stacks on my known thumb when you be back
I don't need something, need the feedback
Let’s follow up, let's follow up
Got something, call some', call 'em up
Got something, something, call 'em up
And I call something, ball 'em up
All the way to Baltimore, all the [?]
And they in the auto mall, whole summer long
And you stay like a Audemar
Head's down, it's the art of war
Head’s down, it’s a war, what they calling for then, huh?

[Freestyle]
No stones, what you balling for then, huh?

[Refrain]
They try to say Kanye West
Was out here wildin' like, uh, Delonte West
But these new verses sounding like Andre's best
But he couldn't ever quite seem to get quite Andre fresh
Three stacks, stacks on my known thumb when you be back
I don't need something, need the feedback
Let's follow up, let's follow up
Got something, call some', call 'em up
Got something, something, call 'em up
And I call something, ball 'em up
All the way to Baltimore, all the [?]
And they in the auto mall, whole summer long
And you stay like a Audemar

Head's down, it's a war, what they calling for then, huh?

[Intro: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a monster, won't let it go to a-
Fed him to your plug, it goes where it goes
The nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me (Yeah)
In a sunken-

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Alien, magical, flyin', and all
Being, I got her signed on
Beam me up, I'm 'bout to sign off
Dumber now, need to take time off
Dumber now, I don't believe the time
Should have gone, man, I believe they lyin' (Get a mic, huh)
Sign, do you believe in science?
Bigger sign, bet they gon' bleed now

[Verse: Kanye West]
Aliens, double to sign off
Better time, 'bout to take time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
Order a bleeding nine, tell her, "Don't leave tonight"
Alien, being 'bout to fly out
Took her out, order her something with eyes out
They was done, we the one, we just on
Louis thong, Lebanon, we become, what they done?
Duh-na-na, duh, feel it, feel it, feel it
This ain't our planet, that's why I kill it
Kill it, animals, kill it, ozone, kill it
Blood, spill it, somethin' you deal with
Alien, took the time off, I just took time off
Fly up, a pyramid, dunked on, Vesuvius
No bro, serious, I'm dead serious
I'm dead serious, I'm dead serious
Alien, period, she on her period
She gonna come here yet, something, then we get
Closer, better yet, na-na, duh-na-na
Alien, takeoff, I took time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
I've just been feeling nine
We gon' just leave at nine
Christian calendar, some-some calendar
Airplane, challenge us, happen to challenge her
Said, "It blow up," Michael Moore said, "No what?"
Ain't nobody die, Alex Jones said the same shit and fried
Oh shit
Alien, pyramid, fly off, take off
Break off, Kit Kat, take off, wake up
Make off, they go, say go, get makeov'
You let go in Waco, Texas
Pull up, err-err, 'Lexis
Flex this, bless this, genesis, precious
Message, message, bless it
Don't stress it, don't stress shit
Don't test it, don't test this
Don't touch this, man they Hammer time
On the dotted line, on the camera time
When it's out of line and they meant it right
Done it down to nine, on the dotted line
Want a better line and I'm feeling right
Kill the feeling, right, oh and I made it rhyme
'Cause I met a time and you're out of time
And you wear the line and he out of line
But he set it off, on the Adderall
When they got it all, set it off y'all

[Outro: Kanye West]
Alien, takeoff, monster




[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uhh, just point out the bounce
Uh-huh, show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yeah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov' the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce
Yes, just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevera
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov MCers
Everybody dupin' the flow, you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga
Uhh, I got y'all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and single that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And bein I'm about my business, not minglin' much
Runnin my mouth, that shit kept lingerin'
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin'
The album width to keep the registers ringin'
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Jeah, you jinglin' baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out, he's so hood

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star
Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread Man even said, "You're a monster!"
Yeah, that's how I feel
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
O.C., OG, Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, "Ray Ray, is that yo' car?"
I seen MTV, I know who you are
You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gots to blow
And I don't play pause I'm from Chicago

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

[Outro]
Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce




[Intro - Background Vocals and Kanye West]
You know, oh you know, I just want you to know
Turn me up, turn me up loud to, loud l-l-l-l-loud, yea, yea!

[Hook x2]
I just want you to know, I just want you to know
I just want you to know, this boy here finna' blow
Southside up in here, Westside up in here
Eastside up in here, throw your hands in the air

[Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga I control the gold
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggas before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no
No means no just as sure as green means go, green means paper
Dream team, caper we see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people, come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

[Hook x2]

[B-Lo]
This track really hot so I gotta spit fire in here
Vogue and a flo, B-Lo represent west side in here
This thang West C-I, do you wanna smoke one to the dome
Better hit her good, knock on double wood
If it don't affect, then I'm gone
I drop bricks on blocks, I got sick on loc'
Radio keep my slide, fuck it nigga, I'm so high!
I set birds in them, but I'm not a Vir-Gee-In!
Platinum shit, that's my plan, if a nigga really want it then
Cadillac, slam the doors, keep a chick all in 'em oh
My niggas all from the go, Do Or Die way too cold
Iced out way to cold, my shit way to fro!
But a nigga already kno! But a nigga already know!

[White Boy]
Rap profit, plat gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat
Pockets mac, hopin' crack, poppin' stacks
Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, options
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
Need ya way, from this place, cause it ain't common
If this ain't the way, Kan-ye, then it's straight
Colleges, in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for my next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

[Hook 2x]

[Kanye West - Talking]
Yo, by the way
This the Academics Genius Level Mixtape Volume 2




[Intro: Mikkey]
That nigga Mikkey. Kanye. Y'all know

[Verse 1: Mikkey]
Man I was sick of them bill collectors callin' my crib
And the filthy ass roaches tryin' to crawl in my shit (all in a nigga's cereal)
Before I flip, nigga had to keep callin' them tricks
See I spit now, now these hoes all on my dick (oh you're a rapper?!)
Like "Mikkey won't you take me out?"
Chick please, it takes more than a rat to get cheese
You can lick deez
I worked hard to get G's
You can strip tease
That's too freaky? Well bitch leave!
I'm a cheap nigga
Keep my money discreet nigga
Cause chickens keep talkin' in the streets nigga
So I keep itchy
With a clip that'll spit fifty
Make fifty million spittin' over beats nigga please nigga

[Hook]
I just got a good ass job
The pay is good but the work is too hard
And I don't want to work anymore
So I won't stop till I reach the top
Now I just bought a brand new car
GS4 but the notes is too high
So I'm gonna hit the club and pull some hoes
Before they re-possess my ride

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Nigga please
You work for UPS
I work for Mickey D's
I plotted on stickin' niggas for at least fifty G's
Run up in they crib for the safe and the keys
Y'all ain't safe around me
We done made wild stacks
Made it to Cadillacs
And still get pulled over for "drivin' while black
While back bill collectors call
We ain't answer ("He ain't here")
Light company will have to come and blow out our candles
Now you know I got's to take a plane to Jamaica
I dream cash like Sega
We workin' with some paper
This spins a lot different from the Cutlass I was whippin'
Y'all niggas still trippin'
Got beef? Pop the clip in
Only a bitch would worry about his obituary
Don't worry I got something that'll get you very close to that
Burn tracks, I ain't suppose to rap, niggas told me that
Now bitch kiss my plaques, c'mon

[Hook]
I just got a good ass job
The pay is good but the work is too hard
And I don't want to work anymore
So I won't stop till I reach the top
Now I just bought a brand new car
GS4 but the notes is too high
So I'm gonna hit the club and pull some hoes
Before they re-possess my ride

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
I used to work at Steak N' Shake 30 hours a week
Niggas ain't even supervisors, tryin' to act like they chief
Talkin' bout "Get them fries. Naw, turn the meat."
Soundin' like a bitch
Hit him in his mouth then quit
Try to picture this
A king on a slave ship
Workin' the grave shift and ain't even made shit
Tell my crooked ass uncle put me up on the lip?
Drop grease, then slip, get insurance, take trips
Nigga what? Set it up
Get with shorty in the front
I've been skimmin' off the register
"Now Che..." "Shut the fuck up and do it my way"
Don't get caught on camera on your off day
Like Ice Cube on Friday
If I worked in the mall, I be sellin' Coogis out the back
Got a gig at Blockbuster sellin' movies out my 'Lac
Any job that I'm at I'm gettin' goofys for they stacks
If the supervisor comes, nigga be cool and relax
Y'all be workin' hard, I be hardly workin'
And even though our check small, our pockets hardly hurtin'
If I was a DJ it wouldn't take me long
Before drug dealers paid me to play they wack ass songs
C'mon

[Hook]
I just got a good ass job
The pay is good but the work is too hard
And I don't want to work anymore
So I won't stop till I reach the top
Now I just bought a brand new car
GS4 but the notes is too high
So I'm gonna hit the club and pull some hoes
Before they re-possess my ride




[Hook: Kanye West]
'ey baby, am I crazy?
Or was you givin me the eye?
You said maybe? (Yea) Well, you crazy
Because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly (You hype!)
Already know I'm too fly
Yeah, I know what you like

[Verse 1: Common]
Right now I'm off the wine, wine, we can take our time, time
So much I want to punch spill the bump when we grind
My uh is in ya body, my uh is in ya mind
Check my dictionary, that ass is so divine
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs
I knock and I knock, uhh, can I come inside?
I knock and I knock, girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between ya thighs
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain
What make it feel so good, that type of stuff you can't explain
I do, what I do, to do, to make it rain
You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad ya came
'Cause you the type of dame to be game and yo
Mic check like the way I begin my show
Girl I come from chica' so in I 'go
Turn around, it's about to be a TKO

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
Some call me Com (Com), some call me the Red (Red)
You can call me daddy, I'mma put ya to bed
An appetite for seduction and it gotta be fed
This sexual eruption gotcha hittin ya head
On the board and, knock, you screamin, "Oh Lord"
We exchange like students cause I study a broad
And listen to ya body and, low key party and
I keep pushin and pushin, you pump the vol-i-ume up
We the type to make lovin we up
We take a ride down south cause you need to re-up
Girl you call me Big Bank like I was savin it up
I'm the doctor, I can hold it 'til patience is up
Ah, ah, ah-ah - I make, I make I make it hot baby
Ah, ah-ah - I know, I know, I know ya spot baby
When we do it like we don't want it to end
It's three PM we gon' do it again

[Hook]

[Bridge: Pharrell]
C'mon girl, let's go
To distant lands unknown
We can fly on air
If love is every where for you and me

[Hook] + [Bridge]




[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do some, do some

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it

[Verse 2: Nas]
Met Gala
42, but I fuck 'em like I'm 22
Backing and hanging that's all I do
I've been through aunties and mamas
Now its they daughters turn
I done ran through money but I got more to burn
Windows tinted, indo in it
I got that je ne sais quoi, a glass of Henny then muah
Here some freestyle, kiss them other lips wow
Bedroom bruises like we did Jiu-Jitsu
That official dick down
Spiritual chakras, frequency
I'm her holistic doctor, treatments frequently
Put her on a elevator to a higher self
Like Monte Carlo to acquire wealth
New dough I'm getting, the biggest my man hit me said 'let me hold something before them hoes get it'
OG flow, tailored clothes
The type to wear tuxedos with 40 belows
Can drop a BB out a spray-can
Driving down Cullens, Nas be wildin'
Rich nigga problems
I've been pimpin' since Big Pimpin', been pimpin'
Jazzy Jeff hoes out the door, Fresh Prince shit
Go tell a friend , bitch!

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill




[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
The world at my sneakers
Gold pieces molded with Jesus features
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable Diddy
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest
My first album due to him, that was my biggest project
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra
It's Harlem USA, I diddy bop and shop with Oprah
(Yeah nigga, what)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster
Platinum Patrón splasher, fuck Cris', spit atcha
I call it rich ignorant laughter
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80s, NYC 5 percent of culture
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers
The studded chain around my neck, it makes the night colder
(Yeah nigga, what.)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love

[Verse 3: Nas]
The Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker
Pretty bitch slobber, ex-robber
Heister, my own life biographer
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping
Summer Jam stopper, Timb Chuck wearing
Cranapple Vodka, then I spray choppers
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me
Draped in paisley bandanas, suits with Adam Stacey
Cigar like Dick Tracy, its dark I get spacey
Alcohol and laced weed, that was part of my 80s
The Cartier consiglieres be near me
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly
Liz Taylor tried to jux me
'Cause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby
When he gets mean
Think fast 'fore I blast hoes like Grassy Knoll
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion
And realest rappin'
Pablo back on the scene, won't roll back up with green
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas
Two of New York's biggest niggas
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers
(Yeah nigga, what)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love




[Verse 1]
Everything I do that's not perfect
Only makes it that, that, that much more perfect
Only makes it that, that, that, that much more worth it
Only, only only, only every time when I short-circuit
Everything I do that's not perfect
Only makes it that much, much, much more perfect
Much more perfect, I need it all
I want it all, I need it all, go through it all, climb every wall
Take every fall, break every law, I need it all, I need it all
Go through every wall, take every fall, break every law
Yeah, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
And I will have it all, and I will have it all, and I will have it all
They ain't laughin' at me, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Nah, I laugh at y'all, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Think you're laughin' at me, no, no, I laugh at y'all
Cause I want it, I want it, I want everything
I want it, everything, I want it all, I want it all, yeah, I want it all
I want it all, all the shit they talk, all the shit they write
All the shit they write, oh, I love it, all the shit they talk
All the shit they write, all that shit to say, you know I love it
Oh, I want it all, I need it all, I need it all
Give it to me right now, I want it all
I'll take it all, take every fall, break every law
Go through every wall, I don't give a fuck, I need it all

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock & Charlie Wilson]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Woo!)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh; uh-huh) with a dozen roses
(Ay, uh; Mr. West) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pete Rock]
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake, only for my man’s sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will
If I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it’s not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock & Charlie Wilson]
Add a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on)
A great big expression of happiness (Ow!)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh; uh) with a dozen roses
(Kanye; ay, uh) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy’s back in style
Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What’s more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Naw, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessy
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed: the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life’s cursed? Well, mine’s an obscenity

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock, Charlie Wilson & Jay-Z]
Add a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on; red lights)
A great big expression of happiness (Ow!)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Let that thing roll; uh-huh; uh) with a dozen roses
(Kanye; Ay, uh) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock; uh) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)
(Ow!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pete Rock]
This is my mama's shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood (Uh-huh)
When I was back in my pajama shit
Afros and marijuana sticks (Woo!), seeds in the ganja
Had it poppin' like the sample that I’m rhymin' with
Pete Rock (Uh), let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don’t needle pop (Uh-huh)
Takin' sips of Pop's six-pack of Miller nips
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale (Woo!)
Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my mama’s
Virgin Marys try to judge her
I’m like, "Where are them Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria (One-two, okay)
They said, "You raised that boy too fast"
But you was raising a warrior (One-two, okay)
We victorious, they’ll never take the joy from us, uh

[Outro: Kid Cudi & Pete Rock]
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (It's Pete Rock, Kanye)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (It's Pete Rock, Kanye)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now, yeah (One-two, okay)
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay




[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm a God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off

[Verse]
Parents are the strippers, strip kids of they confidence
Teach white dominance, question your common sense
See, I've been washed in tradition and I'ma rinse

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm a God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off




Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you,
I love you and I hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency

And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you at least purposely

We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then

Have you ever felt you want to kill her
And you mixed them emotions with Tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights you have a bad fight
And you talkin' about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say motherfucker your mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit
All the attitude
I'll never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you

But Ima be the bigger man
Big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure it's

Bittersweet,
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and I hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency

And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinkin' it
this relationship even got me back to drinkin' and this Hennessy
Is gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
Coz every time that I try you will question me
Sayin', "You fuckin' them girls, disrespectin' me?
You don't see how your lies is affecting me
You don't see how life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes'll be."
And this the first time she ever spit her soul to me

I fucked up and I know it G
I guess it's bittersweet poetry

[Intro]
Let me get more volume
Nah, nah
Louder than my voice

[Verse]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, I know, I know when I see it
Riding down the 405, baby
Pacing, thinking, to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Don’t know why, but I know a sign when I see it




[Dave]
Yeah, the 15 millionth time, 15 and 1
Check it out
Yo Com, how you rhyme to this slow shit
Yeah yeah, check it out

Yo memories of the corner, we huddled and stayed in trouble
Guzzled on 40 O-Z's and played the double and back
We doublin crack, no wonder why they fear us
We cussin cause our mommas couldn't hear us
Young lovers'll cuddle at 15 shit, they seen the struggle so
That makes him a man con-sidered he got plans but
She don't understand that this is where them fools bust at
Same corner where she go and catch the school bus at
It ain't changed a bit, we stand circle and spit bars
Cigarette butts scattered like glass shattered
And pops he play the corner 'til his day comes, DAMN~!
Ambulances on the corner but hey, now it's offi-cial
Cisco was the daze them cups of E&J
Went down and hit a warm spot even in the winter's cold
We had our snorkel and our winter playboys on
These are the corners we was sent to play boys on
Our socks is pockets, the guns is rockets
It's where the after school fight was at, brand new bikes was at
Fila suits, Kangols and new Nikes was at
Same corner is today's same yesterday

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I wish that I cold give you this feelin
I wish that I cold give you this feelin
We was livin on them corners, had a nigga rhymin, drinkin
Whylin, potted out, livin HIGH~!

[Pos]
We live it real, hard, revoke your zeal
God don't come around here no mo'
So why you screamin HIS NAME in vain when the pain hits
Pick yourself up and get to a hospital quick
But leave out the bit, about what went down
I know they hound us for hawkin
Just a flesh wound, stitch it up, keep it walkin
Niggas on the corners loyal, they ain't talkin (they ain't talkin)
Put down the sea of chalk and
The use of chalk is for lines of hopscotch
Or tracin dead bodies for crimes that got botched
For just crime commitin and it's, time to fit it
In the schedule, cause them crosstown niggas
Came to our corner sprayin that lead you pull
Ain't nuttin deeper than pilin in the car
With the streetsweeper so we can clear every star
Off the corner

[Chorus]

[Spoken Word]
You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out  his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I’ll never let my son have an ego
He’ll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean, I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I’ll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I’ll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin’ and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don’t want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don’t be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I’ll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain’t the place to get love
And I’ll never let his mom move to LA
Knowin’ she couldn’t take the pressure now we all pray

Sorry, junior, I already ruined ya
'Cause you ain’t even alive, paparazzi pursuin’ ya
Sins of a father make your life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin’ on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach you good values so you cherish it
Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cut the time in half
So at 13, we’ll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin’
'Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah I'm 'bout Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would drive me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been

Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me




Verse One [Mashonda]:
Every time you were around me baby
Boy you know you drive me crazy
And I really wanna be your lady
That's all baby, nothin' else
I been watchin' you for a few years
Every time you come around, I just stare
There is somethin' I gotta make clear
All I want you to do is

Chorus
Hold me, hold me (hold me)
Show me that you do (that you do)
Wanna get to know me too
Hold me, no more lonely
I'm with you (I'm with you baby)

Verse Two:
We been spendin' more time together
Gettin to know each other better
Baby I am down for whatever
Slowly fallin love
Cause you treated me like a princess
Wit you, don't have to worry 'bout stress
And I really have to confess
You're the best baby

Chorus

Verse Two [Kanye West]:
See none of these girls know me, but they all want me
So when they start runnin' they mouths just hold me
And keep me in your
Prayers so these naysayers
Can't make it through our layers
I say somethin' to warm you up like California
I'm from the Chi, you from the Apple like Fiona
I'm feelin like Prince when he met Appolonia
You feelin kinda tense cause what ya friends have warned ya
Man, they hatin', if they ain't hatin, they insinuatin'
You remember when we first start datin'?
We worked at the mall
They said we like a guy with no muscles
"Oh they'll never work out at all"
And I was just that broke dude that worked next door
But can you please donate some sex to the poor?
Baby, I see it
One day, we'll be drivin' in them crazy whips
I ain't gonna be workin' this grave shift 'til I'm 86
I ain't gonna be pushin' this broom
I ain't gonna be stayin' in my friend's room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
See why we, smoke our weed
You never let these rumors come between you and me
And that's good lookin'
Plus you good lookin'
Plus the hood lookin'
So hold me down like B.I.G. held Brooklyn

[Bridge]:
Hold me down, don't go away (don't go)
Give me your love a million more days
In your arms, I wanna stay (stay)
I always wanna be with you
Anything you want me to do
Baby you know I'll do it for you (you)
(Hold me, show me that you do)




[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ho! I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment, uh
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Oh! We gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day we die, we gon' touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Everybody take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Yeah, 'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, Lupe, touch the sky
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco & Kanye West]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd (Uh-huh)
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb (Yeah)
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth (Uh)
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge (Yeah)
To come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Kanye West]
You gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
'Fore the day you die (What?), you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (What? What? What?)
Yeah, 'til the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Both, Kanye West & Lupe Fiasco]
Now everybody throw your hands up
Uh, I'm sky high, say I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high, I'm, I'm sky high
(Everybody throw your hands up)
I'm, I'm sky high, I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high, I'm, I'm sky high

[Outro: Kanye West & Lupe Fiasco]
We back at home, baby! Yeah
We back at home? Yeah, yeah
Make some noise for Lupe Fiasco right quick, yeah
Feels good to be home
Feels good to be home
Feels good to be home
Feels good to be home
Chi-town
Feels good to be home
Yeah, woo!

[Intro]
And If you've ever been in love I wanna hear you sing it as loud as you can, sing

[Hook]
Suddenly I'm not afraid to try and love someone
Suddenly I feel like now my heart can open up
And suddenly I'm thinkin' maybe you could be the one
Finally I think it might be right to fall in love
So fly on, fly high, come on Cupid hit a bulls-eye
Please don't let me down this time
I think I finally found that guy
So fly on, fly high, come on Cupid hit a bulls-eye
Please don't let me down this time
Cupid, I think I'm ready, ready to fall in love

[Verse 1]
I've been up and down so many times in love
And through it all, still I think I've never really known true love
But this time it could very well be a possibility
Finally, hopefully, you won't let me down this time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
He could be the man of my eternity, but I don't know
If the future has him here with me, but I do know
That the way he makes me feel is so lovely
Mentally, Spiritually, he completes me, Cupid please come closer to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
We should be able to love the way that warriors love
No fear, though we both went through pain like the story of thugs
And cold year was '03, you got to know you I got to know me
Now we can both go free
And fly higher that the Sears Tower
Everybody got baggage though we cleared ours
No more tear showers, I'm in your ear hours
Singing in unison with Luther Howard, love there's flower
And now it takes a lot for me to get aroused
Gotta be more that what's in them jeans and in the blouse
Queen, you're more than a face that's in a crowd
From Chicago so you know I'm tracing ya style
I stay in the clouds and love pure the way of a child
Maybe one day we'll be patient, the [?] saying our vows
Now Cupid's shooting, taking a bow
You never knew love, we making it now

[Hook]




I am not here right now; I am not home
Leave a message after the life. Flat line tone
I am not here right now; I am not home
Leave a message after the life; after I'm gone




[Intro]
(Uh-huh, honey)

Shouts out to Mack Maine getting rich and cocky
Bitch it's still West side, shouts out to Weezy
Young Based God with that 55 heater

With that tiny shirt mane and the tiny pants mane
I'm on Based World and I fuck with, Cash Money niggas
Don't understand, Maine, they gang like a chain
Woo woo! Swag, bitch, Brang-dang-dang-dang
Off the top, I'm a Wolfpack hitter
Man, my life just a painting and I paint you a picture, mane

[Bridge: Brenda Lee]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
Uh-huh, honey (Bound to fall in love)

[Outro: Kanye West & Brenda Lee]

When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound... (Bound to fall in love)

I just want you to know 3x
This boy here finna blow
Southside up in here, Westside up in here
Eastside up in here, throw your hands in the air

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga I control the gold
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggas before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no
No means no just as sure as green means go, green means paper
Dream team, caper we see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people, come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people




[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
(I spit it through the wire, man)
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
(There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)
For a chance at loving you (Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man)
I'd take it all the way
(It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2pac died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
(I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you
(And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
All they heard was I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all ("Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?")
Through the fire ("It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

[Outro: Elton John]
I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah




[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
K. West! Kweli!
Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt 'til she came
Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name
Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Yo, it's all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle
I try to navigate the treacherous waters of
America's ghettos that set up to slaughter us
But there's more of us
Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
Our growing pains go way deeper than Mike Seaver's
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us, but rappers just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you can't stop the music

[Interlude: Mary J. Blige]
An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)
Some many sufferin' cuz deep inside they're scared (so scared)
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yo, the things I'm seein' on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front of a train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Three years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
Tryin' to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life
I have trouble tryin' to write some shit To BANG in the club through the night
When people suffer tonight
Lord knows I try

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

[Interlude: Talib Kweli]
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, make it fit like a puzzle
Come on, say it now
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, yeah

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Upside down kingdom
Oh, they're so scared
Everyday on the news we can't look around with
Something somewhere
I try, I try, you know I try
I try, I try, I try, you know I try
Lord knows, Lord knows we try
Yeah




[Intro: "Groovy Tony"]
Blank Face, tre 8, kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off
Thug life nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image I need to drop, I need to, Blank Face

[Spoken]
July 8th

[Hook]
Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part

[Post-Hook]
Ayy! That part
Bang this shit in the hood one time
Lil bitch I'm back and poppin'
Tell that ugly bitch to move away, I need more options
Broke? Then fix your pockets, all I do is profit

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Quarter million, switchin' lanes... that part
Bet my bitch move the same old thing... that part
405 with the gun off safety... that part
Ayy I'm still tryna make that plate
Rich or poor, nigga, choose your fate
Style on top of style, nigga
Five years I've been rich, nigga
Drove Beamers down Fig, nigga
Pushed Porsches down Broadway
I've been doggin' different hoes, nigga
Got a chain that's worth the Rolls, nigga
Got an engine back with the top in it
Nigga drivin' it like it's a bomb in it

[Hook]
Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part

[Post-Hook]
Ayy! That part
Bang this shit in the hood one time
Lil bitch I'm back and poppin'
Tell that ugly bitch to move away, I need more options
Broke? Then fix your pockets, all I do is profit

[Verse 2]
Made a mil' then I spent it in the same day
Brought a chopper, not the AK
Getting money on a vacay
Couple ranges in the driveway
Groovy Tony in July, 8th
Yeah, I'm killing kitties on a Sunday
How you balling in a Hond-ay?
Paparazzi got a toothpaste
Swerve in the big body
Your favorite artist, I'm his big homie
Yeah I'm walking with a fifth
I ain't folk, I'mma crip homie
Where the bloods? Where the locs at?
Where the bud? Where the choke brown?
Gloves for the combat
How the feds in your contacts?
How the feds in my set name?
Move smooth in a Mulsanne
Hard dread in the rap game
Heard Soulo coming up next
And SZA got a classic, uh
I heard Zay just got it mastered
The fire burning through the plastic
Some fingers to the badges
They don't love us to 'til the racks involved
When I was broke, they wouldn't accept the call
Now they on me for my decimals
Blank faces, gotta X 'em off
Enemies, gotta bob and weave
Gang banging like you said "what's up?"
And the set getting killed for nothing
Felonies, so I steal for my daughter to eat
Hoover Street, the government for me
Blank Face, hey!

[Hook]
Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part




[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'mma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self-down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

[Verse 4: Jay-Z and (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

[Intro]
Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

[Verse 1]
It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason
I can never find what real love is about, no doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I'd sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice, a real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell, and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say "Kanye, he keeps it real boy"
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

[Verse 2]
It's funny
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you to say, "Sign a autograph"
For everybody that sees you cryin that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes
I just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes

[Verse 3]
And there is no Gepetto, to guide me
No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't call her no more
I can't...
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death, thinkin' the money that the-
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left, for a real boy!
They say "Kanye, you keep it too real boy"
Perspective, and wise man say
One day, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
Wise man say




Now what if Michael Jordan decided to stick to baseball and Jay-Z decided to stick to crack
Just Blaze decided to stick to engineering and Kanye never decided to rap?
What if a nigga from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word
'Cept the nigga's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
But kept in mind as long as [?] folks and niggas is dead broke
Some things they gone never change
But it ain't them [?] folks, it's the white folks that brought us over here with boats and tight ropes
But don't forget it was [?] niggas cause
The kings got rid of us, they selling a crackhead soap
Now follow me, sometimes I feel like dream is subtitles
Say things that mean things but hide them in club titles
So you'll hear something real but think that it's meaningless
Like, "Damn, I know I feel but I don't know what the meaning is!"
See that there's what make it so ingenious
And that's why Kweli never was lenient
Cause he know what I got, know I was making it hot
'Fore I was making a lot, 'fore I made it to the Roc




[Intro: Miguel, Jadakiss, Yasiin Bey, DJ Khaled, Busta Rhymes & (Kanye West)]
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care

(But she still my pride and joy)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe & Kanye West]
Court side at the Knick game, who the don?
Plus I worked on your kick game, Louboutin
Birkin bags made of python
She a beautiful nightmare
Turn the lights on, still my pride and joy
So I could see that ass
Word to Martin Louie the King, she free at last
Word to my nigga Joe Crack, you let her hold some stacks
Yeah, before we go to the club, she wanna go to Saks
Still my pride and joy, joy, joy
I let her get the gold card, I'mma hold the black
I let her get the black card, I couldn't hold her back
Cause back in the backyard she used to hold the crack
So I cut them other hoes off like the culdesac
Huh, now what cold is that?

[Hook: Roscoe Dash + Miguel]
I ain't never felt a feelin' like this, I need, some more
You gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
What's goin' on with me and you, is real, for sure
But you gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
Before you steal my pride and joy

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Kanye West]
Yeah, uh, yeah, uhh
I ate dinner after, share with another, yo
She love women and she keeps it undercover, yo
And I love women, so she brings them under covers, yo
Fight then we fuck again, I swear I really love her though
But you're still my pride and joy, and joy, and joy
Don't wanna be a player, help her find another Joe
Just to prove I love her, I use rubbers on my other hoes
And if she ever find out it'd be another blow
And that only me that I'mma have to hit another store (my pride and joy)
Spend another knot, hit another lot
That's how you know if you are in love or not
Bought her moms a whip on Mother's Day
Now I gotta get her the same whip her mother got
Pass the Nuvo Mach

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
I ain't never felt a feelin' like this, I need, some more
You gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
What's goin' on with me and you, is real, for sure
But you gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
Before you steal my pride and joy

May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

You betta tell your boy to keep his mouth closed
Or he gon' get a black tux
And a free wake

When I see Lloyd Banks it's goin', (down, down)

From Thirty feet away he fell, (down, oooh well)
Touch kids like Michael
One roll of the dice, oh!
You wanna gamble wit' your life
Nigga die slow

Now your casket goin', (down, down)

Cause' I hate the Jakes
Pat him down take his cake

And that's how I get, (down, down)
Fuck G-Unit nigga I'm not (down, oooh well)
Used to ride wit' em'
Slice up the pie wit' em'
Got kicked out the group
Cause I wasn't gon' die wit' em'

And that's how it went, (down, down)
At Hot 97 we came, (down, oooh well)
Had Thirty niggas wit' me
Niggas that sport the Dickies
Hoppin' out of cabs
We just want to talk to 50

We wanna know what's goin' (down, down)
Security pulled heat it went, (down, oooh well)
Had to shake the block
I ain't tryna' face the cops
Heard a couple shots
Then I seen the shell cases drop

Told P-nut to get, (down, down)
I looked back and saw my nigga goin', (down, oooh well)
I said,"homie we can't leave em'"
What if my nigga dyin'
Soon as we hit Houston then
We heard police sirens

Oh shit!, it's goin', (down, down)
Guns out, they tellin' him to get, (down, oooh well)
He on both knees
Blood squirtin' out his jeans
Catch 22 should I go to jail or flee the scene

Either way it's goin', (down, down)
So I hopped in the truck and went, (down, oooh well)
Broadway in a black suburban
One thing on my mind
Go hard til' them fags get murdered

Cause he tried to get my nigga shot, (down, down)
But he survived and now he goin' (down, oooh well)
To the station
Police at the Double-U waitin'
On me to arrive and now I gotta shake em'

They wanna take a nigga, (down, down)
We on the same elevator goin', (down, oooh well)
Dodger fitted
Got the Hova lean
So they ain't notice me
Now they mad as fuck
And gotta watch my Range Rover leave

Hit the 95 and head, (down, down)
It's to Philly so I can lay it, (down, oooh well)
Catch the first thing smoking back the L-A-X
Kicked up my Air Nikes
Then I slept the whole flight

Had a dream about it goin', (down, down)
Woke up and saw my plane comin', (down, oooh well)
Missed the palm trees
Sunshinin' everyday
New York's my second home
But I'm from in L.A

And I hold shit, (down, down)
The throne was empty so I sat, (down, oooh well)
And just handled my biz
Theres two sides to every westside story
And I just tell it like it is

And that's how it went, (down, down)
On my son that's all that went, (down, oooh well)
So stop tellin' them lies to all them motherfuckin' magazines
And radio stations nigga you know what happened

Me and Lloyd Banks ain't, (down, down)
Keep talkin' shit, i'll lay you, (down, oooh well)

You niggas ran out the backdoor nigga
All I wanted to do was holla man
To see what was what

Y'all was too fuckin' scared to come, (down, down)
You've been to Compton, you know how I get, (down, oooh well)
So fuck y'all nigga
And it's like that
For life




[Intro]
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

[Verse]
The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until "Annie"
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I "y tu" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don't even write your songs?
But let us all play along
We all know what niggas for real been waitin' on
Push

[Outro]
I do, so, yeah
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
I'm gone, I'm gone, you hear me?
I'm gone




(Intro)
This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

(Chorus 1)
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Goucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

(Verse One)
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that He-Su's?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's...

(Chorus 2)
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Goucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

(Verse Two)
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say f**k getting them D's
I'ma just ride out with these

(Chorus 2)

They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound: that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
(Whoa-oh-oh) A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
(Whoa-oh-oh) But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
(Ayy!) I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'

(Whoa-oh-oh) Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
(Whoa-oh-oh) Eatin' good: vegetarian with the brown rice
(Ayy!) Girls kissin' girls, ‘cause it's hot, right?
(Ayy!) But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
(Whoa-oh-oh) They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life

Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain

Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlives
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Goin' hard the whole night 'cause I ain't goin' back to my old life
I promise

[Intro]
Now you know you gotta turn this super loud
C'mon now, let's go, uh

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, uh, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know you're wondering, how is Kanye spittin' so hot?
'Cause I listen to the Roc and I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money, yeah, I know I'm a dummy
But what I'm supposed to tell a girl in the club
While that ass is getting feeled on
What, I bought a couple build-ons?
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
'Cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children, feel him?
Probably not though, 'less you got dough, you know what I mean
You would think the grass greener when you finally get green

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

[Verse 2]
Man, I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years, ain't picked a career
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

[Verse 3]
Man, I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a Coupe

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

[Outro]
And uh, I decided to stop fuckin' with y'all
Uh, wack ass niggas
And, uh, hatin'-ass, dream killin'-ass niggas
And since I quit
Everyone that supported me, thank you very much
And everyone that doubted me, thank you very little




Kanye West
Drive slow homey... drive slow homey...
You never know homey might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My homie Marty used to stay, Sunny 9th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked the leases, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore girls, go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lakers and our Royals, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but Dawg
Fuck all that flirtin' I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homey
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homey

Drive slow homey...
Drive slow
You never know homey, about these hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

Paul Wall
What it do; I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'llac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin, you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do

Kanye West
Drive slow homey...

GLC
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes

Kanye West
Drive slow homey...

GLC
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go

Kanye West
Drive slow homey...

GLC
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know...

Kanye West
You never know homey, might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got mo' TV's in here than where I live

GLC
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flickin' and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, "Just a Little' Bit"
Just a lil' bit
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homey drive slow

Kanye West
Drive slow homey... drive slow homey...
You never know homey, might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Drive slow homey

Lost and, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and, found now
Turned out, our new love
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
I do, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama, knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found now

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Bridge: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost in my doubt

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
When she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
"What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"

Alright, um, before we get started we wanted a get well shoutout to music producer Kanye West, he's doing fine, but he was in a car accident last week, so we just wanna send him our best from over here at 106 & Park and all of y'all, we hope he gets better soon, and keeps doing those hot beats that he does




[Verse 1]
Where we met, I had to give her her respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back
He jumped in the meter cab, just took her cell and told her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, And I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass..how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she struggling while walking
So I drive past, "Yo" I say "I ain’t no stalker wit yo big ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left my ex, damn we speedin

('Now girl, you mean the world to me' repeats)

I’m a king, you the queen
His and her 6’s and diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then..
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in

[Verse 2]
Baby girl had a son
He was 3, yea I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Naw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie..that’s cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it’s a setback..
I don’t respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you..
But when you make a girl leave a man..
You never really know where she stand..
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you..!




[Intro]
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up
They claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin', my feet is up
I'm leavin' you haters like when Shaq left the Lakers
Just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make Black history every day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Now some women hit the mall and some shop at the thrift store
Some of 'em mix and match to make it look like they get more
Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen, squeezin' into a six
Damn, what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a (brand new) man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
Boo, this the (brand new) jam to dance to
While you givin' me head like shampoo, come as you came
Skip the (brand) name, I won't (brand) you
What you do here stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented, I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some old shit and make it (new) for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg? We can kick it for free, you see?

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
Now Che bustin' and then hit 'em, fuck the cynicism
I'm quick to give y'all niggas constructive criticism
Like "Wait, you basically suck," his mother said "My son wanna rhyme!"
I'm like Ma'am, I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him, but if he step I gotta diss him
I listen to that weak shit, all of it, I can't follow it
(vomit) Excuse me, I'm wack-tose intolerant
"I worked too hard to get my baby baller kit!"
Nine to fives, had me blue collar poppin' it
Now I'm in the club, and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye go back like crew cuts
He hook me up, as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down
'Cause this is just an old beat he had layin' around

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga




[Intro]
Ohh, this feel good, alright, Ye
Carter Trey, all day, let's play, haha

[Hook]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before

That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 1]
Okay, put your hands up if you did it before
Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didn't hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because they probably did it before
Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it but oh, if they did it before
And we did it before, we can get it fa' sho
Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I didn't before
And after I did it they be history though
When I see em I act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe

[Hook]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so if you did it before, be a pro
You gotta act like you didn't before
And everytime I meet a girl
They say that she didn't before
You know I gotta act like I never did it before
But she would be dumb if she didn't hell know
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
If she think that I didn't, hell know
That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla "give me some more"
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four
And when four-o-one came, she was hittin the door
Not fixin' to go but she was hittin' the door
And I was probably butt naked just twistin' an O
Then I call my homies up, kick the shit how it go
And I know they gon' laugh cause they did it before

[Hook]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 3]
Okay, a lot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like if they did it'd be low
Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before
Oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
Ya'll probablly did it before, she probably licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can vision you both
Like I done did it before cause I done did it before

[Hook]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before




[Intro: Slick Rick]
Believe it or not
Believe it or not

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi]
Make no mistake, girl, still love you
Make no mistake, girl, still love you
Make no mistake, girl, still love you
Make no mistake, girl, still love you

[Verse: Kanye West & Slick Rick]
Take the top off, let the sun come in (The lord still shines on you)
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (Again)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off!"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi (Slick Rick)]
Make no mistake, girl, still love you (Make no)
Make no mistake, girl, still love you (No way)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, still love you (No way)
Make no mistake, girl, still love you

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

[Verse 2]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Verse 3]
You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

[Bridge]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

[Verse 4]
To all my second-string bitches, tryin' get a baby
Tryin' get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah
'Til death, but do your part, uh
Unholy matrimony

[Outro]
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (Breathe)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live
And live




[Refrain]
Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace

[Verse 1]
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama Benz, Jeep
With put fifty, I get this on the first tape
But that fifty that break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop, she still made me spin
Back when '80s was in, my dog Crazy Ken had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor, you crazy again
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said, "This car real old," I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
I'mma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside

[Chorus]
Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"

[Refrain]
Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace

[Verse 2]
Please, what I gotta win five Grammys
Before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys?
If I can't bone, I'll get a clone
Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbin', don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for Rocawear
More popular, 'cause I abracadabra my Nissan
To a car throwing a peace sign, peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K
And if CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
I'm tryna find a crazy female with a cutie face
A big pimper on the DL, like UGK
And then I told her

[Chorus]
I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"




[Verse 1]
Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer its off the hook no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste
Even though some niggas I grew up with hate
I keep a few good homies that try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here
The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house
With the extended cord no night is boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]
Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

[Verse 2]
The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami
The cops chase thiefs all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks
If you can't stand up for your spot don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot
Cuz Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call don Juan to flash green on yall
The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]
Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

[Verse 3]
Don't worry about what I do for my city
Some of yall run your mouth too much and what a pity
If you outside looking in, shit seem pretty
But its a lot of shit to do with bitch...I did it
I'm cold in the winter my mink track the flow
With the hat to match cadillacs in the snow
If its a block party the whole hood know
Niggas from 3 and 1st streets overcome the smoke
Its K Town times 22 next shine
Who label he on mine Westside nigga right
To my Southside niggas and my Eastside niggas
And my Northside niggas get high
We really don't give a fuck what side you from
Just keep on hollering out Chi!!!
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]
Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime




[Hook: Kanye West]
And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought

[Verse One: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the Dana Danes and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
Got into thinking its a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
Niggas claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003
(Throw it up if you...)

[Hook] - 2X




[Hook] (Kanye West)
(Stay Up)
Stay-
(VIAGRA!!)
Stay up
Stay up (Yeah)
Stay up (Kinda crazy, right?)
Stay up

[Kanye West]
What she got is so Niagara
Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldn't stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said "I would if he'll handle biz up in the sheets!"
Pop off like a thang thang, he keep keep
And every time that she bang bang, he skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three-peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you, Cassie, and Kim Kardashian
Maybe that'll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now y'all can have sexy time, it's nice!!

[Hook]

[Kanye West]
Man this is classic, call her National Geographic
Her ass is African, but her eyes so Asian
Plus the waist and, time's a-wastin'
This some good pussy, dog please don't waste it
You said "Fuck that, man I'm gon' tape it!"
And came before you barely even got the tape in
She had the maid outfit, it's all on her apron
I know a friend who got drunk and claim a fat bitch raped him

[88 Keys]
I heard that bitch hate men and she covers up her crotch
But she love to show her girls like Sanaa Lathan
And she throwing passes like Troy Aikman
And she really into twisting facts like false statements
He's into twisting backs by throwing his weight in
But she ain't waiting for him to rise to the occasion
He's like "Be patient, this a contact sport
So you can save your pep talk, give me that oral support"
And stay up

[Hook] (Kanye West & 88 Keys)
Stay up ([K]: She said you couldn't)
Stay up
Stay up ([K]: Way up)
Stay up ([K]: But why you don't)
Stay up
Stay up
Stay up
Stay up ([88]: I know you gotta)
Stay up ([K]: You know you gotta)
Stay- ([88]: I need that)
(VIAGRA!!)
Stay up
Stay up ([88]: She told me "Bitch" stay up)
Stay up
Stay up




[Intro: Mos Def & Kanye West]
This next guest.. is my man
Bringing him back, its a pleasure to have him here
Please give it for my brother Kanye.. West
Uh.. Let me start by..
Thanking you know.. for allowing me to come back because this is one of the important days in the year to me... next to y'know Christmas, my mother's birthday and my birthday y'know
Now here goes the story...
My momma calls me and she says "Baby, I'm down in Miami and they playin' your song all day long. You making a lot of money right now. So when you on the tour I know there's gonna be lot of girls out there tryna throw you their pussy"
(haha) I mean that's how my momma talks with me
She says "Baby, imma want you to put on three rubbers cause I don't want no girl out there fucking up our money

[Verse: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know a nigga payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his!
Maaan! he killed that bitch, they gave him 25 years, 25 years
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..




[Intro]
I do love you but it's
I do love you but it's
All alright

[Verse 1]
Fighting to keep us together, hope it's worth a try
You ain't always been an angel but heaven's on our side
I got my demons too, I know just how you feel
You can be real with me, that's why you're still with me
Can't hide behind the carats on a diamond ring
I don't even care if you lie to me
'Cause there ain't much that gets by me these days
I ain't say, "I do" just to say, "I don't"
Don't give me no reason to go through your phone
This is deeper than you and other women, this is daddy issues
This is years putting up with the wrong type niggas

[Chorus]
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on, hey!
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
You tell me you love me, well tell me again, yeah
I need the reassurance every now and then
Love ain't a game full of X's and O's
But I done been played before, I played it safe before
Gave it up to somebody who didn't deserve my body
You gon' have to lend a shoulder, help me kill this hangover
I believe your love for me exceeds the needs
And you gon' take responsibilities
On my healing, how I'm feeling
Don't go trading years that we put in

[Chorus]
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on, hey!
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on

[Video Outro]
I, I, I, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna




[Hook]
"Baby, don't let me suffer, cause another won't do
Baby, don't let me suffer, cause another won't do"

[Verse One]
The game's on, Hot Karl dominates y'all ears
I'm making suckas disappear like Amil's career
I'm just joking but you having trouble coping
Cause you beating me is like Def Leppard's drummer jump-roping (not happening)
Cause me and Kanye made this real picante
And grande, while you suckas act Armand Assante
Suburban strangler, angled to rip a stranger
With lyrics so hard I even make Mystikal say "danger"
And right here's an MC that you should fear
Underground like snuff films, throwing 'bows like Laimbeer
Crushing the rest 'til there ain't nobody left
And if I don't go double platinum then I'm blaming Wyclef
So rhyme for rhyme, line for line let's get it done
None other will do when my crew's out there having fun
Punchlines like landmines, Bensonhurst to Anaheim
I'm dropping dimes while y'all suckas silent like pantomimes
What

[Hook]
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth

[Verse Two]
I'm always into something, got everybody running
It's my year, dawg, warn Tyrese that I'm coming (I'm coming!)
Fucking up the scene, take away the self-esteem
The Jewish Jay-Z, call me William Hollastein (Hova!)
I keep attacking and send your crew packing
Nobody's feeling you, like Kobe Bryant rapping (ouch)
So keep on yapping, it's obvious you hate me
Real racy, expose myself like I was K-Ci
Now I'm bringing new views to the table
Able to bring in more kids than Jermaine Dupri's label (so def)
Take you out and watch you blow come to an end
Able to go three the hard way without Puffy's friends (let's did it)
Changed the game before one song was finished
Spent so much cash, made Farmclub go out of business (ching!)
You ain't touching the Baldwins at all
It's a family dawg, drink babies and suck balls
Like what

[Hook]
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth

[Verse Three]
Can't wait until I'm platinum and drowning in wealth
So I can talk about my cash and sound like everyone else
Wrecking this, more infectious than asbestos
Making heads bob up and down like motherfucking Pez dispensers
I'll take your wig and part it in the middle
Cause any one of ya mizzles ain't fucking with Hot Kizzle (nope)
And that's for shizzle, obvious and of course
Dangerous like sporting ice to the next Source Awards
The shit I kick is on a unique level
And we call it rebel when we got some fights that we want settled
Beatin' em 'til they can't hear like Halle Berry
You try hard but still fuck up, like Darryl Strawberry
Rip you apart, so baby don't start
Driving down Mulholland in a Hummer go-kart
This is lyric shit, tough shit, never soft
Hot Karl dot com, log on, fuck off
Fuck off

[Hook]
Don't let me
Run off at the mouth

Hot Karl
Ripping up some lyric shit for you
That is, in case you had any questions about the content
Yo
Hot Karl
Kanye West
Uh
Right up in your grill like that




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeezy, Ne-Yo, the remix ayo
I think it's time to hit 'em with the Mase flow
My uh, she was gettin the best of me
But oooh, child, you my destiny
And I know it's especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh, and you gon' question me
If she even stand next to me
But you should laugh, 'cause you my better half
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me (c'mon!)
Right now it feels so crazy
I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 in-inch rim whee-eels
Look so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly shit that you be on
Gucci on, Lanvin, Louboutin
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I, like Mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause, you in my soul and system
And we gon' take her home with this one
I got something that you gon' like
You got something that I can't fight
We got something that we both gon' ride

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Think of it every second, I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

[Outro: Ne-Yo]
Ain't no doubt, so strung out
Ain't no doubt, so strung out
Over you, over you, over you
Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug




[Verse 1]
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night like she on parole
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You need to stop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it’s some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Hook]
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You move is like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Somebody please make her stop
Make her stop, stop…
Somebody make her stop, stop…
And we won’t stop

I’d like to welcome everybody to VH1 storytellers
I go by the name of – Kanye, West
You could’ve been anywhere in the world this evening, but you wouldn’t be as happy as you are right now
No, you wouldn’t be as happy as you are right now

We’re gonna run through some of the new songs and some of the old songs
And tell you where the whole thing went wrong, and tell you were the whole thing went wrong that forced me to write these songs
For my love, my love, my love
My love [3x]
That spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
That spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl

Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
Go ahead and stop it now
You need to stop it now

You know, I really like that part of the album
When I said
That was a good one, your first good one in a while
‘Cause I love Tenacious D and I listen to them all the time
And I feel that was the closest I got to like a real Jack Black moment
And there was a lot more that I said, I said

We got to the movies and we laugh at different jokes
It went on and on and on and on…
But I just narrowed it down to:

Spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
Spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
Spoiled little LA girl, man I love these LA girls
These LA girls, man I love these LA girls

Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now

Cause I don't want no Robocop
You move is like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Somebody please make her stop
Make her stop, stop…

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
Action ting, yo, a badman ting

[Verse 2: Assassin]
I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
Becuh we beat murder charge like O.J

[Chorus: Kanye West and Justin Vernon]
That’s right, I’m in it
(Should’ve known I would fall)
I’m in it
(Steppin' on cracks on the floor)
That’s right
(And your boys at your door)
That’s right, I’m in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
That’s right, I’m in it
(Then don’t let me at your table)
I’m in it
(If you just gonna lay there)
Damn right
(Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars)
(I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

[Chorus 2: Assassin, Kanye West, and Justin Vernon]
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
That's right I'm in it
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
Who, where?

[Outro: Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili




[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go 'n back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy sing
One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come boohoo this shit

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle




[Intro]
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

[Outro]
Uhh, ah yeah

Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are
I got you




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1: The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

[Hook: The Game + Pam Sawyer]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes
Did I have under my belt, like boxers
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two... nigga that's mad nuts
Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'
But since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo

[Hook: The Game]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 3: The Game]
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

[Hook: The Game]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Outro - The Game]
God damn, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch
That was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah
Floatin away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video
I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah




[Verse 1]
I, you don't need, need to ever write
I read your last message at least a thousand times
At least a thousand, least a thousand times
Alright, alright, alright
Why would you ever listen to people tryna hate on you
At least you know there's nothing new

[Chorus 1]
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you're ready for tonight
I'm gon' cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
I gotta move, I gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I gotta hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome

[Verse 2]
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing, I know you're lookin' for somethin'
And I got it, why you frontin' on me?

[Refrain]
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new

[Chorus]
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right

[Bridge]
You're so freakin' tight
I know you must be tired
Of running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby I'm awesome, also
I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome, y'all know

[Refrain]
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new

[Chorus]
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right




[Intro: Kanye West]
Aww
Yeah, 9th Wonder on the beat (Aww)
I can't front man, you got some hot beats
It's your boy Kanye Tutta
Got Consequence in here, (I see now) Little Brotha (I see now)
Yeah, I want y'all to listen
Question.. (Aww)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now how the hell I end up arguin' wit this bitch? (Aww)
Know everything, but don't know shit (Aww)
Kinda reminiscant of Anna Nicole Smith (Aww)
I just turn my music up like damn that's some cold shit (Aww)
I mighta known about a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from bein' a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady yellow ease I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a mothafuckin' diet Coke?
He said you lyin' yo, why is you lyin' yo
Cut it out quit it G, you hurtin' my kid-i-neys
Naw, she talkin' bout a couple of kids for me (Aww)
She hit and had a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treatin' fat hoes differently

[Chorus]
Aww, I see now!
You was hurt and you on the rebound (Aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (Naw)
Naaw, fall back, (yeah) if I ain't a playa then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'ma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'ma take it all back

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh (Consequence)]
Look, I write verses do shows for a livin'
Hoes they look at me like everyday Thanksgivin'
Pe check how I'm livin', white T's free jeans
Shotgun and Capri's, big kike like Yao Ming
(And it seems the style then how they go out they way
Just to prove they dedicated and devoted to Ray
I guess it goes how they say, that that pimp will repay
That's why I put 'em to the test like everyday)
Not like a G.E.D. or an S.A.T. pop quiz let 'em know that they mil' ain't free
(It's on like a college degree when you followin' me
Witout that entry level job there's a modelin' fee
So when I tell ya get 'em girl and you prove that you true
I let you bolt up on the block wit the rest of the crew)
This just a couple of trials that we put 'em through
Let a nigga know now what you tryin' to do, for real

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Yo Phonte, five star syllablis females
I hit em with deliverant styles for me to try to lay wit them (aight)
And then chill around the way wit them
Like her name was Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee and them
Spat game, wanna come to my ex-things
I keep 'em line like rollerblades at the X-Games
Fun Tina, but was the type the girl kinda stress things
Til' the album dropped now you thinkin' my rep changed (Ahh)
Look, we ain't sleepin' on the floor no more
But it's a strange misconception I ain't poor no more
That's bullshit, if they ain't payin' fuck a Promo tour
I rather keep my ass home and hit the porno store
So we hit the sex shop cause she wanted to get with me (aight)
Two shots of Yak she started actin' so giddily
Nine months later she went into delivery
And since then I treat my baby mama so differently, word (Oww)

[Chorus]
[Outro: Kanye West]
Yo I swear I'ma take this truck back man
I mean I got the new G5 whatever, that shit be in shop every 2 weeks
I told 'em.. I told 'em if y'all don't take this back and give me all my money back
And trade me in for the CL I'm gonna put it on this Little Brother song in 2 weeks
And they ain't believe me but.. Now I'ma let y'all know don't go out and buy the G5
I swear like it's a bad look for the girls, really they get in the car
And they always wanna look over and be like
"Aw nigga, yo check engine light on, it's on"
I'm like "ya top on, so we got 2 things we tryin to get off right here"
They don't like that
I take it back, I take it back, I just say it to get you maaad, I take it back
I could prove somethin' to you
Y'all been in North Carolina for 2 days, where the hoes at my nig?




[Intro]
Yo G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, ha?

[Hook]
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff in my heart right now man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-town what's going on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry Mr. H said the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell, that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal, she been tryin' to be mine
She a delta so she been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use me trying to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the makin' man
I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like
I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstruct
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half my jaw was missing
In the back of my mouth, man I couldn't believe it
I'm still here for y'all right now man
This is what I gotta say, right here dog
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking 'bout Coke and birds
It was more like spoken word except he's really puttin' it down
And he explained the story about how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive a two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe, safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised, there's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up, like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta Angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought they called me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us, where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid sh** that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Outro Hook]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate in my chin
I said, dawg don't you realize
I'll never make it on the plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
She can't be serious man
(For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down through the wire
Even through the fire)
(Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit)




Let's have some fun now
Get up and touch it
Get up and touch the sky, come on [7x]

[Bridge]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Before the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Testify
I'm up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got them hits to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In a accident, cause this must be heaven

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh(Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh(Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the hits to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Bridge]

Now say: I'm, I'm sky high

Feels good to be home, feels good to be home

Are y'all happy you came to VH1 Storytellers?

Get up and touch the sky, come on

I am so disappointed, that I cannot see me perform
Except for on playback
My greatest pain in live, is that I'll never see me perform
So you are welcome to know a pleasure, that I will never have

Come on [20x]

This song is what inspired 808's and Heartbreak more than anything
Because we used do this at the end of the tour every night
And I would do it for – how many of you saw the Glow In The Dark tour in the room tonight?
Thank you so much, for coming to the tour

So y’all remember at the end of the show I would do this song
And I would say some inspirational words and I would sing
And I had the opportunity to just kind of do it and play it off
But I discovered that I love to sing
So much and to my thing and harmonize and just go up and down and just fuck around

I really feel like a vessel
And I open my mouth and God will let beautiful words flow through
That’s why I realized that he chose me and he has a path for me
Because half the things that come out, I can’t be responsible for
And I guess he just wants me to say more and more and more and never be insecure and always be sure, be sure
And he will give me the strength I need to endure, for sure
As I tour and bring the pure
So much more, more, for sure
For your entertainment, education and relation
To take away your hesitation and segregation

In a country full of immigrants, where no one really was born here, but separated here
It’s a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white
We now have a black and white president

And this is what the future is to me
The juxtaposition: two things that you think don’t go together

When a black, super-Hip-Hop-dressed dude gets on an elevator and there’s an old lady with Chanel and she grabs her purse
I’ll give you a cliché example
What would happen if they actually talk to each other?
What would she learn? What would he learn?

When the rich man hopping out the Lincoln Town Car, passes by the homeless person
And they actually talk to each other
What would he learn? What would he learn?

If a black man, that came from Chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people, ‘cause you do not want to be accused of being gay
Was to talk to a gay person
What would he learn? What did I learn?

I learned that people in Chicago was wrong
And I’ve been an asshole all along
A lot of things that you learn are wrong
So don’t be an asshole too long, too long, too long
You can’t be an asshole too long
You can’t be an asshole too long

‘Cause the more you know, the more you grow, the more responsibility you have show what you know
And give everything that you got to give, baby that’s the reason God let me live through the accident without practicing
Okay, got to bring this up and bring it back again
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Alright [7x]
No publishing Outkast, please
Alright [5x]
Shout out to three G’s
One of the few dressed quite as fresh as me




[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Can't let 'em take your spirit
Never let 'em take your soul

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister don't let your guard down
You know there's more out there waiting for you
Hell naw, no, sister don't let your guard down
You've come way, way too far now

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla Sign]
Lesson learned, lesson learned
Lessons learned, lessons learned, lessons learned
May your future last long, past, present
Faith, love, hold on to heaven
One hand up, hold onto heaven
God bless us with every second on earth
Same as the legend was told
To my ears at five years old

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister don't let your guard down
You've got too much shit goin' on, yeah
But I know you've been workin' through all that
Know you, I know you've been goin' through it your whole life
And I say, brother don't let your guards down
Parties are starting right now
Know you've been workin' that body all night

[Bridge: Ty Dolla Sign]
But it's 3 am and we bout to go up again
It's 3 am and we're just starting again
It's 3 am and we're just starting again

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister, don't let your guard down
I know you've been working hard now
Brother, don't let your guard down
Nah, nah, nah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
And the fight not over, the fight just beginning
The lies get exposed, soon as you win it
The devil is smiling, the guy keeps on sinning
Don't let them take over the heart of them, no

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister don't let your guard down
It's 'bout to get hard now
And brother, don't let your love go
Support her in the best way you know how

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla Sign]
Love on your woman, stand by your brother
Hold on to your loved ones, I know we've all lost some
Pray before rain falls, the devils are coming
They don't share the love but they're up to something

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I know it, I know that they're up to something
I know, I know it, that they're up to something

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
So, sister don't let your guard down
Shit's about to get hard now
Brother don't let them on now
Protect them the best way you know how

[Bridge: Kanye West (Ty Dolla Sign)]
The best way that you know, the best way that you know
The best way that you know how (Brother!)
Protect her the best way that you know
The best way that you know, he best way that you know how

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Sometimes when you have something, it's like you take it for granted. And sometimes something loves you and you don't love it back. See, right now, I wish you was here. I wish you was here so I could hold you down. I wish you was here so you could hold me down. This to my brother, this to my sister, this to my Queen!

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & Big TC]
What y'all smoking on though?
Got some OG right now, some Dolla $ign OG. This shit flight nigga
Oh my gawd, hey you believe this? God damn
I got the uh Wiz Khalifa uh...
Khalifa Kush, KK?
Yea the, nah the Wiz Khalifa little cones 'n shit




[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Tell me right now
Do you really want to spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good
Might do us good, before we be done for good
Cause I can make it good, I can make it hood
I can make you come, I can make you go
I can make you high, I can make it fly
Make it touch the sky, Hey maybe so
All of the time you be up in my checkin' through my cellphone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night, here's another fight
Oh, here we go (x6)

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are, why are you so paranoid?

[Verse 2 - Redfoo]
They said that drum machines ain't got no soul
They said rap was a fad, but its surpassed rock and roll
Yeah my jeans are tight, and my hoes is white
And they play my songs, in the club, every night
We done lit the fuse, we done fuckin' blew
Blame it on the goose but don't blame it on the auto tunes, oh

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are, why are you so paranoid?

[Verse 3 - SkyBlu]
Tight pants, Party Rock shirt
She on my jock (uh-huh), no need to flirt (nah)
Haters mad, say I look funny (oh)
But how you look funny with a pocket fulla' money? (can't do it)
Stay grillin', imma stay chillin'
Shots all around when a nigga in the buildin'
Party Rock, album in stores
Get one for your mama and one for your hoe!

[Bridge]

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are, why are you so paranoid?




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
Got her bikini on
Research, her thing on
Tell me your theme song
Tell 'em, I leaned on
I'm gonna do something I lean on
With my bling on and my thing on
Got 'em all watching when I walked in
Tellin' me stop with my black skin
Couldn't do nothing when I walked in
But the black-just like a black tint
Lookin' for somethin' and you got it
You don't know what you got it
'Till it start runnin' and you got it
They got head and they can't win

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Take it you wanna to the corner
Trapped out the corner
Four in the mornin', rock in the sauna
And I'm on it, I'm gon' get on it

Bitch you want it? You can see that 'till the morning
Trust me, it's stolen, 'till the morning
And I got it and I'm on it (Ah, ah)

[Refrain: Kanye West]
I'm doing 500, I gotta perform (Ah)
They don't wanna go (Ah)

Know what they know when they run up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Take it you wanna to the corner
Trapped out the corner
Four in the mornin', rock in the sauna
And I'm on it, I'm gon' get on it

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse]
I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say"
Chicago nights they, stay on the mind
But I write many lives, they, lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just want to be




[Intro: Justin Vernon sample]
And I know where I'm going to

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm lookin' in Longevity's eyes
I play with Infinity's mind, Forever's my guy
My pedigree, above your ass, you'll never see I
I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly
Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase
Without production I'm worthless
But I'm more than the surface
Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40
I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me
I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students
Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music
Was lovin' women you'll never see
All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities
Damn, look at the jealousy!
Lucky me, I meet some beauties
Make you wanna shoot me
Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie
Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes
Get married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G
Don't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed
One of my exes could be your next, dog—trust me, don't test

[Chorus: Nas]
It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life
It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life

[Verse 2: Nas]
Rollin' dice, throw no aces
With my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres
Other safe bets, nothin' regular or basic
Ridin' back to back, me and Jungle in some spaceships
Where the squad at?
You can see us on the ave, chop it up as always
Stand up Queensbridge, now the world know us
Everybody sayin' my humility's infectious
I just want my kids to have the same peace I'm blessed with




[Intro: Big Sean]
God, oh, God
Boi, boi
I've been workin' all god damn year, I just got my check
I'm 'bout to spend it all on me, I'm worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)

G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now

I need a jail house to free my dogs (Right now)
I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life
So I'ma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"
I'm on

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now

So I be goin' so hard (Right now)
I need my face on a black card (Right now)
My iPhone need a charge (Right now)
My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (Right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now (D-Town)
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Outro]
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah, woah
Four, three, two, one
This to all my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, won't stop right now
Four, three, two, one
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, won't stop right now
Hell nah, won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now
Four, three, two, one




[Verse 1 - Jamie Foxx]
Last night me and my dogs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups and downs had me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

[Hook]
Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx]
When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember

[Hook x2]

[Jamie Foxx (with ad-libs)]
Extravanganza
Extravavganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes it was the things that I remember
And I remember

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Bein' at the bar tryin' ask what that hypno hit fo' (Hit fo')
Knowin' I can't afford to get mo' (Get mo')
Here's a broke nigga tricked buy one bottle and sip slow (sip slow)
Or, or leave the club now
Do like I did, come back when u get dough
A fishstick nigga now we messing with lobsters
We messin' with Grammies, we messin' with Oscars
You messin' with that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on that stanky stank
In the morning you gon' draw a blank
The hotel said y'all was on 'em
My girl wasn't on shit, I picked the wrong one
Steady talkin' bout I ain't like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Never meet ya mother girl
You know they love it when you love 'em
And they tell they friends girl

[Hook x2 (with ad-libs from Kanye West)]




[Intro: Kanye West]
This that rap god shit nigga
I rip every one of these mothafuckas down, ayy
Rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah

[Verse: Kanye West]
Closed eyes, see things
Fire up, tweaking
You in my freak dreams
You in my freak dreams
Bad bitch, you dig that
Get stacks, drive cars
Whip out, bitch out
Tits out, oh shit
My dick out, can she suck it right now?
Fuck, can she fuck right now?
I done asked twice now
Can you bring your price down?
Lil Boosie with the wipe down
A little woozy but I'm nice now
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now?
What the, what the fuck right now?
What if we fuck right now?
What if we fucked right in the middle
Of this mothafuckin' dinner table?
What if we fucked at this Vogue party?
Would we be the life of the whole party?
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody start fuckin'?
Would everybody start fuckin'?
Would everybody start fuckin'?
They don't want nothin'
You mothafuckas livin' like half of your level, half of your life
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto, I ain't gon' lie
We be in the bathroom fuckin' like "baby, don't get too loud!"
I can, I can see it, yeah

[Outro: Desiigner]
Hey, I want it right now
Ball on them niggas, get heated and shot down
You get hit with the pie now
Rolls with killa money nigga get by now
Right now, right now
I'm with niggas that have been to Versailles now
Side now, slide down

[Produced by Kanye West]




Ay Grav, didn't you use to mess with those girls over there right there?
Oh yeah man she loves mad moanin'!
Ha! You know what I'm sayin'? Aight?

Yo premonitions of the mission of this hun that I was lookin' for
Now whores come in scores but this girl had more in store
My foot taps floors as I be in different realms of deep thought
Thinking of how I got caught
We made an even trade
I got the skins while the hottie got played
At least that's what I thought but it seems that my heart's been taken, been took
Cause as I proceed to look through my black book
Name after name, everything looks the same
Seems that the whole situation's gotten lame
Start to question if I can survive in this state of mind where her face keeps on arrivin'
She says (Boy you said you loved me)
I do! (You can't; the only time you want me's when I'm pullin' down my pants)
Well monkey see monkey do, you do me then I'll do you
Girl I'm just teasin' what's the reason for the treason?
(Seems I caught you skeezin') Now girl, what the hell?
(Do the names Tonya and Tameka ring a bell?)
Now my train of thought starts streakin' when a bo like me starts thinkin' of some shit like this here:
Honey you be's the one I wanna be's with when I do birds and bees (Whatever)
But sometimes it be's like that, one of her girls be on up on these, 'cause my shit's fat (fat-ass nigga!)
But the next like she relays on the phone is dial tone, now a nigga chillin' all alone
But I guess since my name's Gravity relationships are bound to go up and then come down

I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(Nigga you thought wrong)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
I thought it was on
(Nigga you thought wrong)

Yo now nobody really knows all of the trouble I've seen since then
It's been about three years but man I never thought I'd see your girl again
But to my surprise, seen her at a party I could tell by the eyes, hips, and the thick thighs
Could have swore she still had feelings, yo
She even sported a dress I bought her years ago
Now this had to be that girl, Lord knows that I was wishin'
Collect my courage, put my mind on the mission
Of fulfillin' my dream of me playin' the role of a king, she could be my lovely black queen
Tapped her on the shoulder, "Yo miss, how do you do, do you remember me, because I remember you
It was back in September of '92" (Um, I think so, ain't your name Drew?)
Well God damn girl, you got the memory of an elephant
Let's start anew yo the past is irrelevant
Grab her by the hand, ask honey to dance
Thank God for givin' brothers a second chance
But somethin' wasn't right, y'all it just wasn't the same
She didn't have a problem with me spittin' her game
But I tried to ignore that fact that somethin' was wrong
Cause the thought feelin' was strong
All night she kept grabbin' me
It was too quick to be havin' me, she didn't want Drew, she wanted Gravity
So now she's makin' tracks y'all, with two off the loosky, same sample that we call groupie
It hit my heart, yo it cut like a knife
I created a monster that was now livin' trife
The old girl had to go, now there's only holy matrimony to my flow

It could have been on
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)
(I thought it was on)
(I thought you knew this shit was on)

(Know what I'm sayin', shorty was straight playin' herself, right?)

(Fat-ass nigga!)




[The Dream]
I wanna see what's under there baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[The Dream]
Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, uh no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no




[Intro]
(Foxy) Gyeah

(Shyne) Gyeah, walk with me

(Foxy)
Gyeah, It's like New York's been soft
Ever since my nigga Shyne been sittin' in prison
Yeah

[Verse 1] Shyne
Check it, sick things, sick rings, this shit is sickening
Sick chains sick aim, 5th bang 5th frame
Bail money lawyers actin' funny when I come through
Hit 'em with a bundle on the humble
Couple notes, seen Boy George with a Rolls
Shit, I want one too
What the fuck I'm gon' do
But get it if it's there to be gotten 'til I'm dried and rotten
And I'm rockin' sideways muthafucka crime pays
I need it, I'll get it, I got it, I'll chop it, I'll double the profit
And bubble the pockets, I'm living to die
Niggas talk fly 'til I walk by and pop somethin'
Muthafuckas forgot somethin', I'm not frontin'
This ain't rap, music this ain't that
You fuck around I'll have you sleepin' where the saints at
Sincerely yours Shyne muthafuckin' Po
Bitch get yo' bags hit the muthafuckin' do'

[Hook] (2x)
May the angels walk with me, more or less
Big things, big rims nigga, more or less
Fuckin' big stars in big cars, more or less
I can say I seen it all and done it all, more or less

[Verse 2]
A G is a G, a ki is a ki, a snitch is a fish (as in kilo)
With no fins that can't swim when I dump him in the river
Charcoal gray R, 12 cylinders bulletproof sentences
Trial day tentative
I sound like who? ya'll sound like trash
Get off my dick and pass my cash
They don't do it cause I rap about it
I rap about it cause they do it
My music's the conduit to a ticket, I live it
Bitch nigga, I cook it and pitch it
Wipe the prints up off the shit and ditch it, uh
Hip-Hop ain't responsible for violence in America
America's responsible for violence America
Back to the flow nose full of blow
Rolls full of hoes, leave a nigga clothes full of holes
The schools didn't want me so the drug dealers taught me
Simple math, step on it twice and bring it back
Get 4 times what you paid, divide the labor costs
And still come away with enough to play
And I see the same shit in niggas younger than me
Runnin' the streets lookin for somethin' to eat

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3]
Ole boy betta get down better run for cover
When I spit rounds ah you in some shit now
Get found slit down to the white meat
I'm from Brooklyn, Vietnam nigga, I like beef
But being a bird in the street, double plight
Livin' a troubled life, father was a jerk
Moms had to work, papi had the works
So I did what any real nigga would do
Got in front the stove, now I got this shit sold
Fuck you punk niggas wit' yo' punk cash
Let the pump blast, put yo punk ass in the trunk fast
The fuck y'all thought
I bury niggas in walls, I'mma trill muthafucka after all
Point blank shootin niggas point blank all the way to the bank
Rip yo face off then I take off
The difference between me and them, you won't be seein' them
No more, nigga, secrets of war

[Hook] 4x




[Verse One: Brisco]
I'm from the cocaine era, packs in my stroller
Two beepers and a flip, startech Motorola
Bally silts, Kangol tilts
Stand straight when the boss talkin, hush yo lips
My affiliates contract hits
I let the street declare war when you want that beef
Talk cheap, get money, I was taught to ride
Loyalty came first and we don't switch no sides
I'ma savage on the block, nickel rocks and heroin hopes
I walked the ghetto like them but I was takin' my notes
Certified goon, the locks on standby
I just need a couple real niggas I can stand by (C.M.B.)
A bad bitch with hips and two niggas on the interstate takin' them trips
I'm into carrots like Bugs Bunny, Young Brisco, the New Cash Money

[Verse Two: Lil Wayne]
Reportin' live from the booth
I'm killin' these bitches, Young Wayne Carruth
Untamed and loose, plus drank and juice
I was once a spark, into a flame it grew
I don't complain to you, don't complain to me
Everbody got beef and I just came to eat
I'm in the game for keeps, if you in my lane I beep
I been runnin this shit and I ain't neva sprained my knee
And guess who came home, Ronnie the O.G
He still on paper, nigga we neva free
And for my homie Streets, I'mma twist one up
He can't even hit the kush he gotta piss in the cup
What is this on my wrist, shit is sicker than uggh
Yo Brisco, there ain't a sky bigger than us
What's good, I'm in diamonds is you tippin' or what
I took your bitch and she ain't comin' back to work for a month, Weezy

[Verse Three: Lil Wayne & Brisco]
I'm in the all-red slide spur, sittin' on Asantis
With a bad redbone that look somethin' like Ashanti
OK, light brown, sorta tan medina
With a, light brown thick thing like Trina
Um, you prolly seen us, rippin' the streets up
With no top between us, You're so genius
That's my word, you know I got you, twin
You a real nigga dog, thanks for lettin' me in
Yea, he in the game now and I'm bettin' he win
And I'm the rap landlord just collectin' my rent
I put the house on Lil' Bris, he gonna eat this year
Stop for the real niggas who ain't see this year
Open your eyes, open your eyes Cash Money has a new face
And we gon tie the shit up like a shoelace
And that's me, the young hood messiah
'07 I'mma set the fuckin' hood on fire




[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, GOOD Music, this our year
Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here
Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh
That niggas know you can’t really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everyone fasting
Big Sean is a don
Cyhi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and thats just common sense

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came Through the Wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red Toupée on the coupe you've been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior’s
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that "butter fly" like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry MaGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day’s a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I’m pressed clean
Detroit’s Angel, I even got red wings
I’m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter
Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my "whoa there!", right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her
And im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch
And now I’m here
That should let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killing
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin
Many tell me I’m the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I’ll see if I seen them naked yet
Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

[Verse 3: Cyhi Da Prince]
I’m Mr Got bread like Quizno’s
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn’t see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
And being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
Im coming after you, him and his spot
Still tied to the streets like a hitch knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the Yankee
Rose wood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimel’s
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual
I’m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I’m impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it’s good for you like a vegatable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

[Verse 4: Common]
F-f-fam fam fam I’ma monster too
You don’t see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audio technique, my technique
I recognise games like the ESPY’s
Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed




[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I do it cause I feel it
Live it like I’m talkin’
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like parkinsons
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan
Thats what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
He's checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed




[Spoken: DeRay]
What in the fuck was that, Kanye?! I told you to do some shit for the kids! You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage! A muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting! I’m tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me! You know what, you's a nigga. And I don’t mean that in no nice way. Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you. You throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body! Cause you gettin' the fuck out of this campus! What the fuck you gon' do now?

[John Legend]
I'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, so don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me, so don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody




[Verse 1]
Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
The fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when
(Reaper)

[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today

[Verse 2]
So come back when I'm good and old
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when
(Reaper)

[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today

[Outro]

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

[Verse 1: Common]
I grew up, talking Chi-town slang
Never played soccer but loved to kick game
Loved chicks with thick frames
And big-lipped dames
Might see 'em on my arm
Cause I charm like thick chains
I was at the Knicks game, they were playing the Nets
Courtside so I could hear the shit they say to the refs
Thugs, this type of stuff you can't express in a text
See the section of girls who be dressing for checks
That's when she stepped in front of me
Light-skinned, long hair like a school days wannabe
A big 'ol (whoo) let's just say she was blessed
She had got it from her mama, God gave her the rest
We was being introduced by mutual friends
Like Kobe in the 4th, that's when the game begins
Game begins, games begins
I'm from the windy city, so I play to win

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

[Verse 2: Common]
We conversated tough about life and stuff
Told her, tonight was just right for us
She was, flavor most and I can spice it up
Be my black Victoria Beckham once I wife it up
Asked when the next time we could speak
I might Khloe you, marry you in 3 weeks
Seen cheeks, she was like 'she don't remember my name'
That's when I realized ain't no gender in game
I thought, like "Man! You don't know me?"
I'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie
Boldly, she told me 'Oh you got moves'
Her friends said 'No, really though, he's a good dude'
After couple months of dating and pairs of good shoes
Being snapped by the papps, we shared the good news
We were engaged, though many was confused
I'm from the windy city, so I will not lose...come on

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

[Verse 3: Common]
She had a dope figure, y'all can go figure
Should of listened to 'Ye, cause she was a gold digger
I ain't a dumb nigga, she was able to pull it
Love happy, blindsided like Sandra Bullock
Or could it be, things go the way that they should
From the, unexpected, love could be understood
And in the real game, only love can win
I got to win, cause I fell in love with her friend

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

Lyrics from a snippet

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
Shower water hit that black skin, your friend alive for you (Alive for you)
Air dry, let me suck that...




[Intro: Kanye West (& Al Green)]
This is actually an official mixtape
It's really me
And I've
(Got good music on my radio)
I got DJ A-Trak on the cut!
(I've got good music on my radio)
I got [Don C Lane?] on the cut
(I've got good music on my radio)
It's GOOD Music!

[Verse 1: Al Green (& Kanye West)]
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
(Right now, I just wanna take y'all back
Right when I hear this music, it brings me back to a place and time
It brings back a lotta memories
So hopefully, when y'all hear this tape)
Lookin' out my window
(It'll bring back a lotta memories for y'all)
Sun shinin' bright
(Yeah)
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?
I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But every since you left, said goodbye

[Refrain: Al Green]
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

[Verse 2: Al Green]
Somethin' 'bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, a brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away
I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather

[Refrain: Al Green]
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

[Intro: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la, la
8732 that's the way it go
Wait 'til I get my money right
Kanye and Jizzle, say it ain't so

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
If I had a billion dollars (YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Yeah, I'd spend all in a day, show these niggas how to play (play)
Top floor penthouse, I'll show them where I stay (stay)
Grand piano, might learn to play (Ha Ha!)
Paid a hundred grand just to walk past it every day (Woo! Woo!)
You know I like them white keys on it (yea!)
Duct tape when we wrap them, call me prejudice
Cause I never touch the black ones (keys that is, Ha Ha!)
Let me show how to do this, shawty! (shawty!)
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (DAMN!)
Patron got me so confused (fused)
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun
Never seen me in the kitchen nigga, I am amazing (nah)
Well, fuck it I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then
If thugging is a term, fuck it I'm it then
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then
Somebody call me a shrink
Until then, I'mma fix me a drink (Ha Ha!)
Top down in the Bent, I'm so intoxicated
Sometimes I think to myself "Goddamn, I made it"
And I know they hate it
On the all night flight
Trying to get my money right, wassup?

[Hook: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
La La La La (Hey!)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Leer Jet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right she gon come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn 'Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars! YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
“Wait 'til I get my money” everybody's motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah, hey, mama they can't hate him
'Cause after all of the drama, K slayed them

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Wait till I get my money right
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

[Connie Mitchell (Young Jeezy)]
(I'm serious, nigga! Hey!)
Why were you late?
(Yeah! HA HA!
Yeah! You know I'm serious, nigga! I got money!)

Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!
Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!
Why were you late?
Oh oh oh oh oh
Good money made!




[Intro: Kanye West]
I want everybody to put they hands together for me
I want to talk about somebody real special tonight (whooooaaaa)
Ok, come on

[Hook: Kanye West]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (hey Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I, I just want you to be proud of me (hey Mama)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine
I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times
I'm feelin' talk about my mama if y'all don't mind (hey Mama)
I was three years old when you and I move to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl (hey Mama)
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl (hey Mama)
And you never put no man over me, and I LOVE you for that Mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin', tellin' you lies, then I started to cry (hey Mama)
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, "Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't HURT no more!"
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta WORK no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford (hey Mama)
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what Heaven do, sent us an angel, and I thank you

[Hook: Tre Williams, (Kanye West)]
(Hey Mama), Oh your son done turned into a man living life
From the lesson straight from the palm of yo' hand (hey Mama)
And I know well that my words - they just ain't strong enough
If I had to pay for yo' love, my money ain't long enough!

[Verse 2: Papoose]
It's only 60 seconds in a minute, 24 hours in a day
The sun rises, the sun sets & goes away
"How this day went so fast?" is what I thought
Only 12 months in a year - life is short
Before my time is up, you know what I'ma do?
Take this time out to say, "I love you"
Cause right after you finished raisin' all ya kids
You turned right around & raised foster kids
We was the first ones in the 'hood with bunk beds
Popped me in my mouth for somethin' I shouldn't said
& when I caught that case, ya face turned red
You picked me up from the precinct - I was a knucklehead
You told me when I frowned up my face & pout
"I brought you in this world, boy, I'll take you out"
Daddy's stressin' you out? You tired of the drama?
Divorce that fool - I'll marry you, Mama

[Hook x2: Tre Williams, (Kanye West)]
(Hey Mama), Oh your son done turned into a man living life
From the lesson straight from the palm of yo' hand (hey Mama)
And I know well that my words - they just ain't strong enough
If I had to pay for yo' love, my money ain't long enough!




[Intro: Mos Def]
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

[Chorus: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh
Good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life (real life), if you try to
So close (so close), but so far (but so far)
And so far (and so far), no cigar (no cigar)
We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today
So I'ma live like it's no tomorrow, no goodbyes

[Chorus: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

[Verse 2: Al Be Back]
Uh, to you
If I part, my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical

[Chorus: Mos Def]
I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

[Outro: Mos Def]
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, more
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm known for running my mouth
I will not be accountable for what comes out, uh
I dunno, I might have said it
I was kinda gone and light-headed
And my jacket kinda fresh, bright red
And as usual, my pants tight-threaded
It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit
Don't get it, twisted, or dreaded
I am the king and will not be headed
To the morgue no time soon, brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin
That'll only get my engine revving
While y'all on 10, I'm on 11
I'mma make the news, be on at 7
Matter fact, I'm on this very second
I'm in first and y'all in second
And this verse only add to the freshness
Call to the club, tell them add to the guest list
What you think? Way more bitches?
I can never be too big for my britches
Y'all motherfuckers know who this is
I'm gifted
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

[Hook: Lykke Li & Santigold]
I'm armed with pens, I've got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time

[Verse 2: Santigold]
You don't know my mind
Like I've said a thousand times
I gotta stay ahead
Know what I'm fighting for
I'll leave you to your talk
Never seen my kind before
And you're all so thick-headed
Follow and I know I let it
Part of me won't let me quit
Won't let me just not say shit
So much is there to be bored with
Can't be still, I can't afford it
Try to hold it in, but it makes me sick
So I spit it up, say to hell with it
I dream it and I build it tall
Make a way for when you fall

[Hook: Lykke Li & Santigold]
I'm armed with pens, I've got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time

I'm armed with pens, I've got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the
I'm armed with pens, I've got my rhymes
Whatever comes, I write it down
So knock me out and shoot me down
With mics in hand, we'll stand against the test of time




I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
Woke up, I spent it on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
It's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Until they get the message
Now I'm under more scrutiny
But I act more stupidly
My momma couldn't get through to me
I'm talking like it's just you and me
I guess the money should've changed him
Should've forgot where he came from
So let the champagne splash
Let that man get past
You don't need to stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes, cause
How do you move in a room full of no's?
How do you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
He must be in tune with his soul
He's buried in a tomb full of gold
They'll be looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Wait till I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothing right




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Let's go!
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit-ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give–, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and–
Uh, what's scary to me
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came
I came, I came, I came

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now, it's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she's talkin' 'bout freakin' out
Baby, we can work it out
C'mon, work it out, let me hear you say, work it out
Let me hear you say (Work it out)
I gotta hear you say (Work it out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say what? (Maybe we can work it out)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said, "Get It Wet"
Ooh, girl, your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks, yeah, I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on 16 (Bars)
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day, girl, we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies (Now)
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit it, girl
One and, you brought two friends
Okay, three more, now hop in the Benz
Four-door: do y'all know the difference between a five, six– uh
Say, all the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in 'fore you start back datin'
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballers, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talkin' 'bout freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
C'mon, work it out, let me hear you say (Work it out)
I need to hear you say (Work it out)
I gotta hear you say (Work it out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say what? (Maybe we can work it out)

[Intro]
Kanyeezy you did it again, you a genius nigga!

[Hook]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first
Emergency, doctors performing procedures
Jesus, I ain't trying to be facetious, but
"Vengeance is mine" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming

[Hook]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic
All the static, shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis, to a head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth
'til that time, it's on and popping, church
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk, the more you irking us
The more you gon' need memorial services
The Black Album, second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

[Interlude]
Man, I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy 'til somebody die
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
(Let me get serious for y'all, one second)

[Verse 3]
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer
Asking him "why?" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again

[Verse 1: Common]
Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

[Verse 2: Common]
Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

[Verse 3: Common]
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner




[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really really wanna catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
I must really like you

You're doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild

[Chorus]
It feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Bridge]
"I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin like, "Oww! (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention? (Oww!)
You're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' (Oww)

[Chorus]
'Cause my lovin' feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Post-Chorus]
Will you ever know it?
No no no no no, no no
Will you ever know it?

[Spoken Interlude]
"I'm gonna have to just go ahead and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to -- to Michael?
Oh hey, how you doin'?
Uh, I feel kinda silly doin' this, but uhh...
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
'N your cuff links are shining all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time, but...
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah
So, what day did you say?
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man"

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
Baby, baby, I swear, it's like ooh
But you don't know my name, no no no
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Outro]
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)




[Hook: John Legend]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, body

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Okay, the hundreds here, [?] Thursday
They ordered champagne, why they look thirsty?
Rock Forever 21 but just turned 30
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
Success, and time for the dancin'
It's like the first time back in the basement
[?]
[?]
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Hook: John Legend]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
[Hook: Charlie Wilson]
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, body

I say whip it
Whip it like a slave do
With all these credit hours, my nigga
Look what I made you
Oh you complainin' talking bout
What I ain’t gave you?
Lets kick his ass out and see who he gone complain too
30 Hours 30 Credit Hours
You failed fifteen Lance
You want back 30 hours?
I thought that you were not my slave
I thought that you were getting paid
From the concerts Fuck Shit Up
You had it made
Comparing FAMU to FSU
You set the stage
For all the hatred stuck in your way
Wildin like a monkey
You shouldve stayed in yo cage
Words from Cameron Jackson
Feel like Kanye to Bush
Switch to Humanities, my family
Tell me how the shit looks
But it's hard to say
You saw the devil by the man in his looks
I stopped posing for the cameras
And got it off the books
This what happens when a nerd
From the streets of Tampa Bay
Gotta hold of the world and got it crazy
Fuck yo institution
Man look how they try to play me
Treating me like J. Cole
I'm more like Jay Z
Ushered in a new flavor
Without a reasonable doubt
We raised them babblon towers
Falling asleep on the couch
My aquifer aquafina
While we deep in a drought
It ain’t dollars or clientele
Then what we speaking about
They ain't wanna nigga like me on the road
See i was out wildin cutting classes
Getting shows
And this was such a battle
Cause this rappin is my soul
And this acting
Was just how a nigga got it out the hole
They gave me scholarships
Thats how i got all them holds
Off my account
I'm an entertainer putting golds in my mouth
I'm hood i rock a Polo let my slim fitted sag
Trap nigga in class with them eighths in my bag
These elitest wouldn't want they daughter
With a nigga like me
Nobody's as socially awkward who can fit in like me
Trap nigga from student loans nobody did it like me
In Tallahassee nobody was for the city like me
It go 813 all day, Florida Boys got it next got these streets crazy
But not until they pay me
I was tryna give niggas roles they never had
Cameron wasn't with it nah the school ain't front me the bag
Said, Fuck it talk to all of the niggas the school had
Said we was gone get right
And we gone make em front us half the school’s worth
Just make sure that school work
And anybody try to play make sure that tool work
I’m tryna keep my sanity amidst humanity
But scary ass niggas like Cameron be
Too stuck in a bank book
Can't stand the heat of students
Who alert and in love with they art
Man love wasn’t even a second thought on his mind
So he couldn't comprehend my steady hustle my grind
I'm saying you couldn't front a nigga like me 30 Hours
To finish my degree, fuck it they just wanted to finish me
All I need, is all my health paid all my debts
Even the rent I was backed up on
I gotta second job after workin the wingstop
Flippin and serving the pack
And then became the wingstop
Cannot understand the supremity of my mathematics
These bag addicts is at my front door like have at it
But not until they pay me

Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super-sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from

I feel like it's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like it's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know he's stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say, "Damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more?"
"You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me"
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely
I ain't lyin
So lonely, I ain't lyin!

[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"




[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Mmmm, ay-oh
Hey... Ratatat, yeah!
Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I gon' get it, I'll be good
Oh... oh man, oh, ah, ugh
Room's spinnin', room's spinnin'
Pat, Zuli, where...
Oh fuck, oh my God
Why'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh, mh
Oh, fuck

[Pusha T]
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God’s in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change

[Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don’t know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
What’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I’m got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m going after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, its like that ya’ll
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Pusha T]
Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I’m Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what’s inside this pinata
And rolling kilos in gymstrada is one saga
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Feels like I’m doomed to dealing with women whom
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
But adios I blow my own dice before I toss ‘em, loss ‘em
Some other muthafuckers double crossed ‘em
Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune
Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But the devil red, tires double tread
I’m posting parks up. that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look what the devil did
Yeah

[Kanye West]
It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I’m in Polo’s they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!




[Ad-lib: Kanye West]
Uh, ya know what?
On the real, uh

[Verse 1: Brandy]
Me and you, we've been through
So much that we need to start off new
You need to choose, don't be confused
I think it's time, time that you
Tell me where you wanna
Be with me, or be with her
This whole ordeal is such a blur
See I was prepared to take a loss
But my heart won't pay the cost
You don't know where you wanna be

[Chorus]
You don't have to take my advice
You don't have to compromise
'Cos I know that you don't realize
You don't even see
Where you need to be

[Verse 2: Brandy]
Be with them, all your friends
Claim the Clippers is playin' Boston
I won't be sloppy seconds again
Do you want to play with me, or play with them?
Tell me where you wanna
Be in love Is that enough
When all the problems start adding up
Ladies, raise your hands if you've had enough
Scream as loud as you can if you've had enough
'Cos he don't know where he wants to be

[Chorus]
You don't have to take my advice
You don't have to compromise
'Cos I know that you don't realize
You don't even see
Where you need to be

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Why you say that baby?
It's all good show
Are you for real?
Come on man, don't talk like that
Ey, ey, hey I promise in all honesty, I honor you, you honor me
For better, worse, for rich or poor, whatever, it's gonna be
I'm talkin 'bout forever more, the rest of eternity
No need bein' insecure, I know where I wanna be
I know I made a lot Of mistakes
But I can make 'em up (Make 'em up)
Unless you got your heart set on breakin' up
If I can't see your face then my day ain't even worth wakin' up
Especially with these haters and open cases, this time enough
Maybe show you attention is something that I ain't done enough
But you got all my love, on all our love, girl
I need you to believe in me
You need to know that I know where I need to be, ey

[Chorus]
You don't have to take my advice
You don't have to compromise
'Cos I know that you don't realize
You don't even see
Where you need to be

[Chorus]
You don't have to take my advice
You don't have to compromise
'Cos I know that you don't realize
You don't even see
Where you need to be




[Verse 1]
You're kissing me and saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm and lay with you tonight
Baby, I feel the same way, I don't want to leave
Wanna hold you close and feel your love inside
But I don't wanna play myself
'Cause I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't wanna fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy, I'm so conflicted in my mind

[Refrain]
Boy, you keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you, baby, I'm so lost without your love

[Verse 2]
Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now, boy
It's hard for me to break away from you, baby
Never could resist you and I still haven't learned how
And I don't wanna be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
'Cause I don't wanna miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance
Boy, I'm so confused down deep inside

[Refrain]
Oh, you keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you, baby, I'm so lost without your love
(Baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
(Baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
(Lost without your love)
(Baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
Oh, you keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside and much too late to drive
You know I need you, baby, I'm so lost without your love
(Baby stay, baby stay, baby stay)
(Stay tonight)
(Stay tonight) You keep on playing
And you keep on saying
(Stay tonight) Baby
And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying
(I'm so lost without your love)
And you keep on saying
(Stay tonight)
Baby, baby, baby... oh
(Stay tonight) And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying, baby
And you keep on saying
(Stay tonight) Stay




[Chorus]
I never liked you niggas
Who knew one day I'd be just like you niggas
Uh, alright you niggas, uh, alright you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Verse 1]
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why? He at least Hooper-Size
You know I scrutinize, like, "Who this newer guy?"
I'm my mama boyfriend, I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasn't
Tryna get to know me, homie? Just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me, you just trying to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents' bad choices
The aftermath of divorces, the kids of bitter split-ups
And babysitters, grandparents that don't know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing, short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing, church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance?
When you get here anyway? I already got parents
Don't try to put me in line, I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it, I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that'd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out, "I ain't going to sleep no time soon!
And when I do, I'm sleeping in my mama's room!"

[Chorus]
I don't like you nigga
If I was old enough I'd fight you nigga
I want to run over you with my bike, you nigga
Don't go to sleep at night, you nigga
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

[Verse 2]
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see I'm dating, having problems of my own
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around
I never thought I'd ever raise another nigga's child
He don't like his mama's boyfriend just like me
Don't wanna do the wrong thing, that's very un-Spike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama, there
'Cause when she here, he be quiet when she leave, he be talking again
He be wilding out, be calm
I don't drink the drama or sip the Dom-Tyler-Perry-on
"You gonna marry my mom?" Look, I don't read palms
And I don't read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look, little man, kids don't make the rules
Even though I ain't raised you, you your mama's angel
Don't get it twisted, baby boy, I'll Ving Rhames you

[Chorus]
I never liked you niggas
Who knew one day I'd be just like you niggas
Uh, alright you niggas, uh, alright you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?




[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Find my back in the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm caught in it again, see 'em all strapped in an' can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God, shine your love on me, save me, please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long, ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin’ out nowhere, where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, everytime I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson, Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong

[Outro: Kanye West, Kid Cudi & Mr. Hudson]
Both sides lose somebody
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Somebody dies, somebody goes to jail
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord, shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Shine your light on me
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong




*Lyrics from Snippet*

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Like this, huh
Not to mention, they like to call me POTUS (Uh, uh)
Like Bill Clinton, I'm asking, "Where the ho’s is?" (Oh)
Oh, just

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We floatin', we floatin', we floatin’
We floatin', I'm just

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yeah, I think I'ma touch down immediately

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Straight out the jungle




[Verse One: Kanye West]
Aye, Aye, Uh
You love my diamonds don't ya
Love the way a nigga shinin' don't you
Baby what's your dis-position?
Have you ever tried this position?
You my dream girl from the posters
That I thought I would never get close to
In the back limousines with chauffeurs
Right next to the Testarossas
It's funny how all the jewelery
Just gets your cat so purry
And it look good altogether
They say they all forever
You love my diamonds don't ya
That I bought from all this rhymin'
But I know you'll never love me
You'll only love my diamonds

[Hook]
When I love baby
I'm gonna love ya, just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds
And when I wake up every night
(Boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds, Diamonds
I treasure you
Cherish you
When you rub my body
(oooooooohhhh)
Cause people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds

[Verse 2]
Like every girl
I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls, and pretty diamond rings
But you're my precious possession
I rock you 24/7
I do (I do), I do (do)
All my accessories, yea I'll give em' up
I'd even trade them in for your love
And the ain't no way
I'm giving you away
You're my d-d-diamond daddy
And I just got to have you

[Bridge]
You sexy, you Fine
I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind
You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

[Hook: Repeat x2]
(oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds
(When I love you baby)




[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands
Is anybody out there?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The magic man
The show goes on in 6 minutes and this is his lovely assistant
She's so beautiful don't you agree?
He made her to the star she always wanted to be
Buhblaaoowww, are those the stars you wanted to see?
The magic man could make the roof disappear in every car in his fleet
Was on dubs, he could take a bird flip it to 3
Release the doves, turn any bar into the fight club
Gotta fight every night to prove my love
You messing with this joker but you need a king
Cause he'll club anybody trying to jack his queen
I'mma call a spade a spade from the start
He gave you diamonds, should've gave you his heart, you see?
Jealousy strikes again, but she, said I'm just trying to wave at the man
Then he, turned her eyes black and blue with the wave of his hand
The Magic Man

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands
Is anybody out there?

[Verse 2: Malik Yousef]
The magic man
Abracadabra, from a dime piece to pieces of a dime bag lady
Each package, new baggage
Implemented a tragic plan
A volunteer from the audience, for the magic man
I have doubt my hat with natural flowers
She wanted work but wouldn't put any actual hours
Her dude had the keys to super natural powers
So she still with this new guy who can supply that white tiger like Siegfried & Roy
Indeed the boy, had that sweet street magic like David Blaine and she made it plain
If I had any advice that could save her, I could just save it man, and I can't understand that baby
She said you ain't no Houdini, ahhhh I know I ain't
I am an artist that can help you escape
Do y'all feel that, or is it cold just in here
For his next trick, Ta-da, he made her soul disappear
The magic man

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands
Is anybody out there?

[Verse 3: Common]
The magic man
Voila!, she knew that I was into the stars
I didn't have to tip her, she was into my bars
A Tender, as slender as the pictures you remember, when you were younger
You wonder how she get from under, the sheets
She do a trick and keep it discreet
She wore a mink, fuck a rabbit just to keep the mystique
High like the magic frank had in the streets
In the sweetest way her status and her habits are meet
Its kinda tragic to see, this young woman cut in half
Thought she was the one but she couldn't do the math
In a flash, so fast i watch her ass disappear
He had game, pulled a quarter from the back of her ear, and macked in her ear
And played with her dreams, in a world where everything ain't the way that it seems
Under her spell, she let any dave cop a feel, I tried to tell the girl the magic man is not for real
The magic man

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I am the magic man
Got the world in his hands, world in his hands
He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands
Is anybody out there?

Lick the black, get the cream, like a Oreo
Hit the track, get the C.R.E.A.M., same story, yo
Trick that on Armani Emporium, it's more important, though
Yes sir, my aura is orchestral, but way fresher
'Cause I simply throw a symphony, on a SMPTE, but I know
That niggas steal beats, so after I emcee, I empty the M.P
So I can stay out of reach, they used to say, "You'se a producer"
I'm glad I never listened to you losers, cause now, I'm in
Shibuya, buyin' somethin that's, way too exclusive
Uh, ra-ra-ra-ra-rappers are in danger, this floor is from a manger
But meaner than Lucifer, yeah, and this is the new drug
I'm the new high, y'all want ya weed back?
Yell, "I still love H.E.R., Hanto E. Rap!" (E. Rap...)

[Sugar J]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo

This is J 'Sug', yo
I know you been around the world, man
I don't fuck wit' the sheisty niggas
I don't fuck wit' the sheisty hoes
I done did it all, nigga

[Loon]
Yo, what would make a scared man pull a trigga'?
The same thing that make a scared man act bigga'
The same thing that make me grab my tec and empty quicker
Adrenaline rush, on the hush
You will die fuckin' wit' us
Vacant lot is my home and In my team I trust
So don't talk about them things if yo' things don't bust
I knew a guy like you, his name was Filipe
Had me on 3-way with the D.A
Tryin' to find out where we stay
So on my 24th b-day I'm locked up in V.A
He don't know my guns turn commotion to slow motion
Then from slow motion to no motion
Run up in the place he hip hoppin'
Spit shots in, clip droppin', if I get caught, get Cochran
And give Pedro my pesos so he don't snitch while I lay low
For 'bout a week or two
Come back like peek-a-boo, you see me, I see you
And if you talk, you be in ICU

[Cardan]
Yo, yo, this Cardan
I know you know a hundred brotha's that sheisty
Like I know a hundred brotha's that's real
But I think it's time you know how we chill

[Meeno]
1 - I have been a hundred places and nothin' excites me
Hit a hundred ho's and none of them wifey
For every thousand that love me
A hundred don't like me
So how you wit' a hundred cats and none of the sheisty?

[Drag-On]
We the niggas wit' the homicides
And got niggas the most traumatized
And how they actually sat there and watched they mama die
But don't worry about it, you second
Just had to get her first
Cuz she was the one that gave birth
And we can't have no more dirt in the earth
I hate to be the last nigga to turn off your lights
Without usin' a switch, and throw you in a ditch
Ya body don't fit, cuz niggas could still see ya kicks
So do you really wanna take that risk?
So unball ya fists cuz I'm always a step ahead of ya'll
You ball ya fists, I cock back
You take a swing and you got that
And that's what they gon' mop at
This gun is from a foreign land
I don't know why it got it in my hand
And I'm gonna get off every penny
I don't care if its automatic or semi
If I payed 300 flat, that means I'mma send a hundred cats back
If 300 attack, but it don't hafta be an exact
I'm gonna get the gatts and get 'em all in one house, and run out
And sprinkle some on the grass, and spit on it
And come back to a pile of ash

Repeat 1

[Meeno]
Yo, yo, yo, a hundred sheisty, a hundred and quicker
We strap up inside the 18-wheeler
A drug dealer with cold cash, but so as
To get his stash would be no task with no mess
Love to get you hot and blast, than fast
My infared beam is on yo' ass, my team is on yo' ass
Plot and schemin' on yo' ass
That bitch you came wit' stay screamin' on her ass
Put three on her ass cuz nigga, we love the cash
Harlem World niggas got G's in the stash
No questions asked, time will tell, Heaven or hell
You don't wanna be the nigga who be catchin' the shell
Meeno, and then I be, be the team to prevail
So when you pray, tell Jesus how you wanna be helped
MuthaFucka!!!!

Rock-a-bye baby [repeated til end]

Repeat 1 until fade




[Intro: Kanye West]
La, la, la, la, la and everybody say
La, la, la, la, la I know you, I know you

[Kanye West]
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be
Armor All flow cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man, dog, trust me
Bust somebody head, GLC, where was we
Still rock the Prada, 'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 1: Common]
The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eatin' Joe, you still talkin' no carbs
A conscious nigga with mac like Steve Jobs

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open, I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him, "do you have any Grey Poupon?"

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 3: Common]
You in the building but the building's falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Bout to school y'all niggas, you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside walk it out, while still you're crawlin'
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say, "Ye ran up at the Oscars"
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, Holla
We some true Chi-town legends, accept no imposters

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Common]
The un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it, rock wit it, Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and beat it, like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to do the right thing, like Spike do
Through conflicts that's crucial and drama that's psycho

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Interlude: Kanye West]
La-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la

[Outro]
We’re coming from the—-hey

You might have to spice it up
Spice it up, spice it up
Take your life and
Yo, we’re coming from the—-hey
We’re coming from the—-hey




Part I

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy, I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga

[Pre-Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not important
I'm focused (Two, three, four)
Bring in the horns

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suchin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, God damn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigga
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
When we ate, it's the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me? (Two, three, four)
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas (Two, three, four)
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' (Two, three, four)
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?" Yeah, my nigga
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters, "Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money (Two, three, four)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny (Two, three, four)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (Woo) (Two, three, four)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (Skrrrrt)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level (Two, three, four)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God (Two, three, four)
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy, I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room, damn
(Two, three, four)

Part II

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's, yeah (Yeah)
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, Domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear
This them Golf boys, like them Hot Boys
For the nine-nine and two-thousand
But its the two-thou' and the one-four and the one-five
Yo, what up Wayne?
What up Slime? Nigga, go hard
Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head (Yeah), that's a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that one-nine-nine-one
'Nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause nigga I'm a god, a divine one; Tune!
My trigger finger wise but my 9 dumb (Yeah)
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rolie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel (Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy, let's get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot (Uhh..)
Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini, I know
It ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange
Nah faggot, it's Golf Wang
(Two, three, four)




[Intro]
At last I am free
(So lost, know what I'm sayin')
I can hardly see in front of me
(I'm tryin' to get to the top)
I can hardly see in front of me
(I just need some sorta direction baby you know what I'm sayin')
At last I am free
(Yup, feel like I'm goin' in circles right now)
I can hardly see in front of me
(Lord help me)
I can hardly see in front of me

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' like I'm losin' my mind, I'm walkin' blind
I'm just rollin' no destination no point or time
I'm lost, tryna find out which way is up
And get what I can get before my days is up
My life was rough, but fuck it shit it could've been worse
I'm free, when I could be in jail or a hearse
Most folks look at my lifestyle and say that I'm blessed
They see my smiles they don't see all the heartache and the stress
They don't see our hoes and foes pretend to be your friend
They love you and down for you 'til your cash flow in
When shit switch they split quick to treat you like a stranger
Then your hangin' like a hanger and give you the middle finger
Like you done somethin' wrong cause you don't provide 'em with drugs
Or do the shit you used to do like payday weigh in the club
I'mma show y'all some love if you don't love me
It's fair exchange or nothin' ain't no robberies
I'm so lost

[Chorus]
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me
(I'm so lost)
At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

[Verse 2]
I saw it a million times niggas balled and fall
I witness boys on they feet kneeled down and crawl
I know nothin' lasts forever everything must end
Losers live for the day and the future planners win
But at the same time, niggas grind and shine
We live in danger who's to say tomorrow we won't be dyin'
What's the use of workin' hard if you can't display
What's the use of bein' a baller if you can't go play
It's a lotta ups and downs, smiles and frowns
One day you're here the next day you're gone
I used to dream of gettin' money rockin' diamonds that blind
Nowadays I wish and pray, for a peace of mind
I was safer when I was broke I had to dodge less snakes
When you got some, you don't know who's real or fake
Every day my heart aches from the drama that unfolds
This world cold, I'm tryna find my soul
I'm so lost

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna stay focused, keep both eyes open
Stay on top before my career starts slopin'
Ain't no time for jokin' no time for chokin'
They wanna see me broken I know what they hopin'
Writin' rhymes 'til my pen starts smokin'
Makin' sure hot lines are spoken I got the token
To the game, and it's my job to claim
The fortune and the fame that the industry bring
It's simple and plain, those that work hard share profit
Nobody can stop it you can't stop 'til you got it
I'mma do what I wanna do, live like I wanna live
Spend what I wanna spend yield what I wanna yield
That's how it is I'm controllin' my fate
And shinin' on those who hate to see me live great
I'm snatchin' my plate, takin' my steak and eatin' good
I suggest you do the same and get the fuck out the hood
I'm so lost

[Chorus x2]




[Intro: Kanye West & Young Thug]
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
Tell everybody I'm back in town
High lights
Tell my baby I'm back in town, town
High lights

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Young Thug]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, oh no
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo (slow motion)
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Thug]
We only makin' the highlights
(slow motion, slow motion, slow motion)
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights

[Bridge: El Debarge & Kanye West]
One life, one night
Uh
High lights
That's all I need
Livin' the life 'til I die

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich
Uh, 21 Grammys, superstar family
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
I'm about that Farrakhan, life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm, I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
One time for a nigga really gettin' it
Two times cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas: impregnate Bridget
So when she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches hah?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walkin', livin', breathin' god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back, heh?
What you want?
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack, heh, huh?
Uh, I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

[Outro: The-Dream]
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Oh lord, oh lord
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Oh lord, oh my lord




[Busta Rhymes]
Excuse me
Tell me, who you really really really think is more lyrical?
'Cause everytime I go somebody gotta see the medical
And everytime I come, I’m eating everything that's edible
And if you ain't already know, then who be more incredible?
They wanna call me crazy like I’m borderline cynical
'Cause how I do it and I kill ‘em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you don’t like it then you can suck up on my genitals
Ta-ta-ta-tal ta-ta-ta-ta-tals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me, you better salute the general
'Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
(Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp)
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
'Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that he's uncomparable again - okay
Killing everything I think we ’bout to have a funeral
A lot of you niggas be doing whatever you be doing
And I don’t even know what to call it, just sound terrible
Lower down the chorus, see we have another burial
These niggas that be rambling and babbling
I ain't hearing them
And everybody know that I be handling my B-I
When it come to other rappers niggas know that I be scarin’ them
Chop, chop, chop chop
Chop another beat up
Now you see the way I heat up, everybody wanna meet up
Just to come inside the building and witness another killing
Then I relax and then shop back and put my feet up
Every beat that I'mma touch I’mma lace
I’mma never stop even with a muzzle on my face
When I finish with this sissy, I'mma leave without a trace
Nigga kneel down better say grace
I go HAM!

[Verse 1]
What's the best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less of they time
What's the best form, best, best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less time
Now, if you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
If you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
Then we'll have more time to make real figures
And we can still keep it lookin' at them like
"Damn, look at those real niggas
With they chains and they cars, but they still niggas"
Cause soon as a nigga gets it
Then another nigga wants to get it
Soon as another nigga has a girl
Then another nigga wants to hit it, admit it
Soon as a nigga has a crib
They want to break into that nigga crib
See where he live, see what he did
And don't wanna do the same shit he did to get that crib
Get it? You know, when niggas is killin' niggas
What's amazin' to me
What don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy
Cause they don't phase me
Cause I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people don't think
See, I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people just don't think
Now picture this; now if I show up onto this motherfucker
And express myself creatively
They always want to say, "He's crazy, see"
And when they so distressed
What would be the best thing to write?
How 'bout this: "Kanye West wears a dress"?
Yes, now maybe that can take away from the way
I kick them niggas ass on 12/12/12
Maybe that can take away
Nah, nah, nigga, they seen it, these niggas seen it theyself
Well, and my grandfather ninety-seven
He said, "I ain't never seen you get down like that"
He ain't give a fuck about the kilt, this dress
Whatever the fuck they call it
You see, niggas killin' niggas
You can't see through the fog
With all the negativity that they write on a blog
I give a fuck about what somebody think
If that person doesn't think
It's too early in the conversation anyway
You know, they say, "You should be embarrassed
You should be embarrassed, you a nigga
How the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in Paris?"
You should be embarrassed, you should be
Didn't you read the reviews, the press?
I don't give a fuck, I guess
I don't give a fuck, no, it's not that I don't give a fuck
It's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up
And it's not that I'm crazy, no, that's a lie
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
And I would die for what I believe in
When I see that, uh, just a change what y'all receivin'
Do you all receive us? Do y'all believe it? It's too much
Okay, there's someone they can't touch
How 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity?
That's me, that's me, niggas killin' niggas
"Why he do that? Why he wear that?
Why he say that? Where he play it?
Oh, my God, nigga, niggas
It's bad enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough
But you can never say I didn't give my heart enough
And if we did somethin' good
And we didn't say, "Oh, excuse me. Pardon us"
Then they want to throw niggas back
On, on, on the retarded bus
And when they riot in the streets
They gon' say, "What, what the fuck started us?
And made 'em start it up?"
And look at me like I ain't smart enough
And everybody got a suggestion and a lesson
And a question and a stress
And then they always want to stress a man, uh
And say, "Maybe he's too aggressive", or, uh, well
Maybe the shit you doin' is just not impressive to a nigga
So let me make this clear
It won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout nobody comin' to Atlantic City
Talkin' 'bout, "Oh, it's just a casino show"
Or, "It's just New Years, so we can't do nothin' really creative"
No, I'm talkin' about a motherfucker workin' every day
From four o'clock in this buildin'
Readjustin' all these fuckin' cameras
To make this show better and better
Better every night for y'all
And all they can say, "He got a mask on. He crazy"
But they just tryin' to fuckin' deter you
From what you are seein' in front of you
This is "Jesus Walks", this is "Can't Tell Me Nothing"
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
So maybe let this time open up your mind
And let you know that you can do anythin' in life
Yeah, baby, you can shine
This right here lets you know you can do anythin' in life
With enough time and focus and focus and time and time
And don't let nobody tell you
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique, so here
Since they'll probably put this online
Let me make this shit real clear
Michael Jackson died from a lack of information
From motherfuckers bein' around him lyin' to him
Actin' like shit okay, but I'm a find the information
Don't believe nothin' that they say
Don't matter who you look up to
Don't take more than ninety percent of what the fuck they say
Cause they are not you
And that extra ten percent is what makes you you
So you do what the fuck you want to do
And if somebody tell you you can't do it
Be like, "Man, who the fuck are you?"
You only got one life that you know about, you only got
And time is somethin' you can never get back
Most important thing
Don't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get back
So don't forgot that cause the money could go
And you could spend it over and over
And over and over, over, over, oh
And the cars could crash
And now did that tell me, "What do you have?"
And the house can burn down
And whose your real friends when you turn around?
Yeah, that's your clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad ladies




[Verse 1: Game]
Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless - but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain

[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)

[Verse 2: Game]
That's the crack music, nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin', roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head
Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears sunk the Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)

[Verse 3: Common]
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for our sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, broads, they see the light
Can't deny my Jesus piece that’s so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A convo piece, she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)




[Intro]
Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...

[Verse]
Is it the because my beats the nicest?
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul, sold twelve times gold
That's six plat, man, that's a sick plaque
Man, don't forget that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear, I feel the phoniest
'Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
'Cause everybody wants your spot, No I.D. told me this
Oh, I seen homies get sheisty on me quick
Woooooo, just imagine if I only spit
But I do beats too, that's the American dream
Stack to make sure my shorties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments, got niggas sayin'
"There's the Kennedys!" But oh, yes, it's the Wests
Brand new Roc-A-Fella, most fresh to death is
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie LA
That keep my shoe game early like the grave shift (Uh-huh)
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship (Woo!)
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit? (Look)
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics
Air Force, check, Rolex, check
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the check? (Styles)
Roc-a-Fella piece, check, don't forget the neck
Is it the money on deck that keeps on the honeys on the dick?
Now that ain't really rhyme, but I ain't really tryin'
(I don't give a fuck)
Last 9/11, I was poor on the Ave
'Til I pluraled my math, now it's Porsche 911
And I'm floorin' the gas, got a lot of problems
Money's one that I not have
Date ballplayers' wives, that divorce and got half
Shit, I figure they deserve somethin' for all them hours
And that be the realest shit I never wrote
Only book I ever read I could have wrote
48 Laws Of Power (WHAT!)
Me, Gee and Hop, uh huh, the game's ours (WHAT!)
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain
Than my real one, 'cause on the real, son>
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuckin' smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children, feel him?
Prolly not though, unless you got dough, you know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Regina, you ain't been in a Medina (Quit lying)
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena (Uh-huh)
Yeah, y'all the invisible ho, you ain't never seen her
Mhm, she must stay around your grandma's crib
Right next door to where the in-laws live
I brought a man from the fifth floor all in y'all crib
Haha

[Outro]
Remember niggas back at school
They didn't have no girl at school
So they be like, "I got a girl, she just stay by my grandma's crib" Hahaha
Yo, Dame, where the fuck you find me? Hahaha




[Chorus: Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Drake]
(Watch out) Watch out
Why, nigga? (The cops out) Cops out
(It's all love when I ride top down) Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 5: Drake]
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 7: Drake]
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

[Outro: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on?
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all

[Verse 1]
I got house in the carriage yeah
I got black love in marriage yeah
They gon say you can't have it but
I'm like don't kill the messenger
We gon break the stigma up
Huxtables to the Obamas
It ain't about where you been
Where you from
What you got
It's all about love
Self love is the best love
When you go take that wristband off
That pity party been over
Don't need makeup to dress you up
I gave birth on the bathroom floor
Just me, Iman, and headphone cords
Don't let this life defeat you
I hope this message reach you

[Chorus]
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hundreds
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies
Home is where the heart is

Home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up

[Bridge]

Spiritually conscious

That's my frequency
Spark up burn the sage
Clear the room kill the hate
Love is the new wave

[Chorus]
Play catch with the hundreds

[Lauryn Hill Interlude]
Above all you keep your clarity
You keep your focus
You keep your sense of love
And you keep your sense of purpose
Those are, they're integral
You know, they're key
Happiness
You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world
But if its not enjoyable, if its not sustainable, you know
If you can't be a person of integrity while having all these things
What does it matter?
What does it mean?
The value is internal
Your value is internal

[Bridge]
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it
We got love
Love, love
You better believe it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ayo, rippin' y'all niggas is the easiest
Y'all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine, they the greasiest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to run when my niggas be rollin'
Holdin' your gun, especially if you owe 'em
Watchin' yo back, especially in the mornin'
Now niggas give you a pound and tell you, "Be safe."
Like you carryin' a million dollars in a briefcase
Now you're all paranoid like, "Is this shit laced?"
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast
Turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
As long as you sure
My point is mainly that
We maniacs
Maniacs nigga what

[Hook]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Nothin' nice when you fightin' for your life
With the ruger, did he shoot him?
Did you see it? Was it right?
Did he deserve that? (naw)
Ask 'em maine
Did he know he turned his son to a bastard maine?
If I see him on the street, I'mma blast him maine
Have a ? and a ? in the casket maine
This guy saw me on the strip, tried to out the thang
I told 'em, "Slow up. This wasn't even about you maine."
He must of thought I was scared though
Unprepared though
Oh no
Here come my guys hoppin' out the Volvo
Fo' fo' out in the clear
One shot hit 'em in the ear
Open the trunk, put 'em in here
What it is stick? Put it in gear
You need to know you can't fuck with my blood
We
Throw you in the trunk
Get you drugged
Take you to your own grave
That's the shit you dug
Now it take at least six niggas to pick you up
C'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
Got my money and my loot now
Tell the truth now
Don't make me grab the .380
Don't wanna shoot ya
You got a little girl?
Think about her future
You need an outfit
These slugs should suit ya
Like 5-0 my nigga, I hot pursuit ya
Bullets trimmin' the side of your head like crew cut
Used to be po'
Never could afford new stuff
Even so
We grabbed ski masks to do stuff
All on ten
Niggas was high and juiced up
While you livin' with your girlfriend like a moocher
Get your own shit, be about grown shit
When the chrome spit, you can hear a bone split
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you gon' get
After you dead, killin' him is just a bonus
Ding ding ding
You my millionth customer
Yo K? Why these niggas always think they can fuck with us

[Hook]

Down down
Down down
Down down




[Instrumental]




[Verse 1: Grav]
My style stays on point like spraypaint on eight trains
Try to picture that shit and it'll blow you out the frame
Now c'mon, my rap skills are beyond
Verbals make niggas fold like futons
When they try to switch styles and get convertible
I loosen up screws so that their joints ain't workable
My tongue is a drill on a mission to kill
Sabotage all those who put up a facade
And fake like they're kings, they're just peasants
Tempted like Christ meetin' the devil in the desert
Repentin' for their mortal sins
Tryna fuck around with Grav when they couldn't win
Yo check my lyrical microphones
Just like [?] speaker cones
See when a nigga spends time in the lab
It works fast so we givin' others jet lag
That's how me and my team keep catchin' [?]
And expand like bands on a soloflex
So what all these bitch niggas want?
Ain't no need for Grav to ever front, yo forever like this

[Hook: Grav]
What these niggas want from skills you'll never [?]
Represent Down to Earth forever, who? G-G-G-Gravity
Yo what they want? Front skills never mean
Represent Down to Earth forever, who? G-G-G-Gravity

Oooh God I warned yah, I hit that ass catacorner
And still be gettin' straight to the point
Smoke mics like joints, wack rappers on the ave
With nothing better to do for the evening, now [?]
[?] behind in a cloud, ka-pow
The dirt and dust, from ill lyrics that I bust
Rhymes are more underground than archaeological finds
So thus I influence minds, like narcotics
I [?] if you don't [?]
[?] funk mechanisms than robotics
I be tellin' weak crews, come on [?]
[?] in a planetary like [?]
I [?] cause my flows is prime
And my mind skills is optimus, it ain't no stoppin' us
Yo even if you built the strongest barricade
GRAV breaks through, niggas still gettin' slayed
Yo even if you had the longest ruler
You still couldn't measure, nigga's too deep like sunken treasure




[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out homie I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it (hey)
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Martin, Louie the King Jr
Startin' all that stuntin' is gon' ruin you
If B.I. was alive, he'd prob'ly have the 2-tone
With the Grey Poupon, anythin' 'Ye poop on
Will explode cause I am the shit and this is my commode
Uh-oh, there they go
Talkin' 'bout how your boy's clothes extra tight
I just remembered that my limelight extra bright
I hit the strip club and girls get extra hype
You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke
We know who not gettin' no sex tonight
And a lap dance'll probably be a blessin', right?
So all the shit you talkin' dead, coffin
Light the weed, coughin', new crib, loft in
Where it's at? Austin, where is that? Texas
What's in front? Benzes, what else? Lexus
Well who's Maybach is this? Mr. West's

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it (hey)
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Boss!
Kush burn like petroleum, crib needs custodians
Shades in all shades, these made of rhodium
Used to be the Oldsmo, hoes call it oh-lo
Now I got so many horses, bitches call me Polo
57, 62, tell me how you wanna move
Yeah, you know I got them both, beat your ass black and blue
I was barely gettin' pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter, Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the real contender
Celery for Eben Gregory, I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is ya tellin' me other than your gender?
I'm a boss and I'm ridin' like a small Vogue
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'em 'til they fall off
Yeah, Ross!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it (hey)
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Well alright, heheh!
All black Maybach, I'm sittin' in the asshole
Classy as a mother, still gutter like a bad bowl
Benjamin Franklin on X how that cash roll
That's right, the mills do like damp clothes
I eat your meal too, we don't feel you
And we be strappin' up like the Navy Seal do
Sweet as banana split everytime I peel through
Fresher than Will Smith and Uncle Phil too
Watchin' TV in the Maybach in traffic
I'm on my feet like Tough Actin' Tinactin
I'm runnin' this shit, you should try tacklin'
Lil Wayne in one word, immaculate
You see the BIG, you see the Jay, the 2Pac in him
The Kurt Cobain, the Andre Three Stacks
And then I'm back to doin' shit like I do's in Maybach music
Yeah, Young Mula baby! Oww!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it (hey)
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music

BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull

Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Stand up! stand up!
Stand up! stand up!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper'
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see these, these is the sweetest Adidas
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save my ass
It ain't a song it's a video, call Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins

[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move you move (just like that?)

I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game]
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
And the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that]
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from [too many ladies, ha]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out

[Hook]
I love girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz
I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in layman's terms, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm movin through her student body union and
She, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I make it up in summer school

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin girls out, [just tryin girls out] just tryin girls out
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a P.H.D.--A pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well--I'm in the club for a limited time only
2 way or phone me if you tryna bone me
Yo man got moe-nee, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinded Nia, a dark skinned Aaliyah
A Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out thats why I barely hear ya
I be goin' in and out just like a robberia
I’m tryna take this money like Rob and G-dep
Then i'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it get so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still, K-A-N-Y-E
Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C
She say she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free

[Outro]
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my nose? can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently
Just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me




[Hook]
I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen

[Verse 1]
Listen, I know my position, I'm young, your profection is distant
I run to it, it feels like it comes closer but misses
I been exposed to the most vicious, meanin' I know the difference
Between those that are dope or those that are Pulp Fiction
My words are weapons, they serve and protect
Behind verbs and a lesson I teach for the nerve that your testin'
I'll reach you from like thirty directions
Heat you like, the early detections like he questions the reaper to strike
Your number it came and crumbled your fame, into a ball
A umbrella dissolved into flames, you under my brain
You fell in my shower, lyrics my power
Your time is now, this is your hour to listen and it's windin' down
Your mission to make your way if your smart
He play his part, you can never take away his heart, listen

[Hook]
I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen

[Verse 2]
My spit is like a fix or the rinse cycle that gets
Under the dirt, that gets, under the skirt of your bitch
Under your nose, so get onto your toes
This is the reason you ballers is leavin' me all in control, my brother
You should play the back if you loud, I make you fade the black
If you wild so you should stay in back and be proud
I never take for granted my style cause him who handed it down
To me, Slim who demanded, take advantages now
I'm breezin' away from competitive ways
Every day I'm leavin' a race, I'm leadin' every step of the way
That I'm breathin' and the reason that the hunger's increased
I'm under my peeps speed and I'm underneath the numbers I seek
I speak if you never show me respect
No longer lookin' up to rappers, in fact I’m after the ones that I’ve met

[Hook]
I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen




[Intro]
Ah-ahem
This something I did
Something I can explain how to
I can't speak for everybody, but, uh
Man...

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah, fuck it, I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and we get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in 92', I was just like you
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think, yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel

[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong? Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
"You never listen to me," then the call drop... hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call, one ring, two rings, seven rings
Eight rings, er mother picked up the phone
Like, "She in school and she don't stay here no more"
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf’s, black skinnies, T and hoody
Call me black muscle brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin’ love, showin’ love baby, dap and pound

[Hook]
(WOO)
People talk shit about me
Deep down they knowing they ain't right
Hmmm, When I walk into the room they can't look in my eyes
When I walk into the room they can't look in my eyes
(Know what you did to me baby, you know who the fuck you is)
People talk shit about me and they know that I know
And they also know that they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes

[Outro: Michael Jackson]

But I'm black and Mexican, we gon' change that, haha
I hate you niggas too!

[Hook: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some
Your girl ain't got no ass, she need to buy one
Out west, Southwest, where you fly from
New Jersey, Teterboro where I fly from
You ain't got no Ghost, you need to drive one
That bitch is so broke, try to find some
And she ain't got no money, tryna find some

Hahaha, hahaha

Hahaha, hahaha
You still owe me money, nigga, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got a bad bitch at build-a-body
Get a bad bitch and build a body
When your pop, the slim nigga shady
When your pop was Slim, I was Baby
I came for them chips like I'm K.D
Came for them bricks like I'm Maisie
We hit up the trap which is booming
Hustle, French John Newman
Fuck making the move, we the movie
Fuck the whole group, I'm a groupie
All that money rolling through the lobby
VVS is dripping off my body
You can do what you want when you got it
Go get a bitch and then build her body
They wanted Versace Milan
We do what we want and then copy
Smack a Roley on my arm
Skrrr, middle fingers to the feds
Put a hundred dollars on your head
Price of life hit you
And all my dawgs gotta eat
And all the money get divided
Snipe game be the wildest
Get a bad bitch, build her body
Get a bad bitch, build her body, haan

[Hook: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Harlem to the death, I'mma forever front
A problem with the kid is what you never want
That's what you want, I had my niggas waiting for you
Like you sitting at a table in a restaurant
Slice you like pizza, I keep six in the squeezer
My jewelry is nice, dressing is iced
It's how you can sit in the freezer
Keep my dick in the diva, word, no problem licking it either
Baby girl could be a believer, we could just kick it like FIFA
All the women heavy like pallbearer
That Henney got that cake like Carvel
Carvel, me, I'mma die
Inside the pussy, man, I know just how Lamar felt
My bitch sit on me flat without no tummy tuck
She no stripper but all she do is pick money up
Five-o called me over, word to my homie, I ain't tell 'em shit
He seemed aggy, so all I did was tell him this

[Hook: Kanye West]
If you ain't had good pussy, nigga, try some

[Intro]
Yes, yes
Brooklyn, stand up!
Ugh! Young's in the building!
Marcy, what up!

[Verse 1]:
Allow me to re-introduce myself!
My name is Hov! H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then, you can call me
The CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'!
Fresh out the frying pan, into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain
That's right, Hov!

[Interlude]
I ain't done...
Check it out

[Verse 2]
Real niggas respect it, fake niggas want beef
'Cause they know that's the only way we ever gon' speak
We never gon' see eye to eye
Your type of real, I don't recognize, it's all televised
Mobsters opt to, not get in beef
There's no business in it, it only brings police
Wankstas want beef and they name in the street
Most time end up with they brain where they feet should go
You should know if you gon' do somethin'
And you go to radio, we all know you frontin'
They shootin', nobody dyin'
Somebody better put somebody body on somebody iron
Sometime soon or somebody lyin'
I ain't buyin' that shit y'all shovelin'
I ain't duckin' for nothin', cousin
I'm too tall to act small, you liars

[Outro]
A'ight, that's enough, I'm done




This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'mma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gonna be some different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyoncé, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that Jesus?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's

Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits? Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say fuck getting them D's, I'mma just ride out with these




[Intro]
Yo, this sound like some movie shit, right?
Get your popcorn, get your condiments
You don't wanna miss nothing, okay, listen

[Verse 1]
They call me Edward Scissorhands 'cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out What Lies Beneath right here
The Preacher's Wife don't give head, get a divorce, man
The Kids been calling you the headless horseman
Like Sleepy Hollow, see she swallow
Suck like ol' girl, got booed at Apollo 13, Ghosts
Use my Hollow Man for Friday 13th
You be Ghost, Backdraft from the toast
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, they Almost Famous
My bling got 'em calling me Lord of the Rings
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
But I Don't Say a Word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

[Refrain]
And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
One, two, Ye coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again

[Verse 2]
Shit's deeper than the Sleepers
The Jeeper Creep up on your block and cops Clock-us
Try to Baller Block-us, use Absolute Power
You gave him 9½ Weeks, why you trying to Rush Hours, huh?
And in The Cell don't drop soap in the showers, huh
They try to give me Life, I'm out in an hour, huh
Back on the block with more Juice than Pac
Making mo' money 'cause of The-The-The-The Roc

[Refrain]
And I'm living a movie, not living by rules
Yo, what you talking about, man?
One, two, Ye coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never sleep again

[Outro]
I said some shit like, umm
If you in my things, you Suicide Kings
There's only Three Kings, Me, Myself and Irene
You know what I'm saying?




[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?

All the models to the floor right now, huh?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wildin', I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s bein' offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still givin' you it all like the coffin's near

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave ya
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin' now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Verse 5: Kid Cudi]
Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image




Intro [DJ Boom]
DJ Boom, beats on streets and here with my man Kanye West
Producer of H to the Izzo, Takeover and all that. Let them know man

[Kanye West speaking]
Yo, it's Kanye to the man. Just play my shit man
Let a nigga hear somethin' finally. (Holla)
Yo, DJ Boom, back for the first time. It's really my first time yo
This is...Kanye to the. Not on the beat though
You know what I'm sayin'? ON the beat motherfuckers
What up G? What up Hop? Look, c'mon

[Verse 1]
As a shorty had a Schwinn, look that's the best bikes
Shorty had three friends, that's my best dykes
Said her best friend wanna see what Kanye West like
Cause her man dress like a transvestite
You ain't know I get a deal because I rhyme tight
Sport Rocs before your deal to be an Unsigned Hype
Give a fuck about your rippin' down some open mics
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these beats for free, psych
You rappers too lame, you ain't James, y'all ain't worthy
I fly out to Newark just to get some new jerseys
I be back to Chi about every two Thursdays
I can't buy water around niggas too thirsty
I can't rock ice around niggas too hatin'
Can't rock Motorola, niggas two wayin'
I Alter like Beast in an altercation
Infrared make you juke like Walter Payton
So, grand theft auto
Come up out your auto
Mobile, before I pull more steel than Soprano
Still trying to make more meals than McDonald's
So cut my slice like Giordano's
And they did
I made 500 Gs in this
First beat on what The Truth and The Reason is
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
Now, tell me that's that regular producer rap
You can listen to the flow and tell I used to rap
You look in my eyes
Think I won't use the gat?
Until
Paramedics gotta use the bag
Cause
In my eyes, you'se the fag
You're like a hermaphrodite dyke dressed in drag
So let's see how many slugs that vest can have
And you ain't really the worst, you just next to last
Uh, Kanye to the...motherfuckin' West

Outro [Kanye West speaking]
Yo, DJ Boom, good lookin' out man
Cause ah, niggas is really doubtin'
Niggas lookin' at a lot of motherfuckers they see on TV
And just figure-they be like, "Oh, you rap?"
Naw, motherfucker, I just did beats nigga
To have some shit to rap on nigga
Ha ha, I'm tryin' to understand, why the fuck if a nigga got hot beats
He can't have hot rhymes? Why is that nigga?
Why niggas just can't do a lot of shit good?
What a nigga can chew gum and tie his shoes at the same time?
Fuckin' A&Rs




[Produced by 88 Keys, Dave Tozer & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Broken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods
But I won’t run, I’m with you, that’s enough
Kiss me now so you won’t run

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Love is an ocean
Swimming and try not to drown
Right in the waves
Praying we don’t go down
In the undertow I’ll pull you out

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh




...it's hard to deal with ya
Kid Cudi told me take the black hole darker
I tiptoed around...
I wish I dressed as fresh as Shia Lebeouf
Why Ye? 'Cause Shia Lebeouf dress fresh as fuck
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Nigga crazy cat about to blow dis, Get rich and stay lowest
Laid in the cut but ya'll bitches still know this
When it comes to chips, you know my niggas stay focused
What I mean, We gotta eat, Ain't nuthin' sweat with that broke shit
Gotta stack it all now, So we can creep
Blowin' smoke out the door now, Boat by the shore now
I'd rather use my mind first, Instead of slugs
Hittin' niggas when the nine burst, Nine bodies and nine hearse
Nine funerals all held in the same church
Thinkin' it's gonna get better but dog it only get worse
Never seen success in my life, son that shit hurt
Possessed by the demons at night, Shit I've been cursed
For all my niggas holdin' it down, Smokin' the pund
Keep ya gun close and keep low to the ground
There is a lotta unfamiliar faces roamin' around
And I won't be satisfied until they low underground

[TMR and Pikasoe Black]

Betta keep ya eyes open and ya hand on the chrome

[TMR]
Everymorning I, Start my day off B, All Alone
Sometimes I feel like it's just me and the weed, just me and my seed
Can't even trust my Manz Lord, Whats the plans Lord
I'm in Need, Can't go back to makin' niggas bleed
Or back up north, Or back and forth
No Time for slackin' off, seen the Devil in my dreams
Gotta back him off
He makes me do things, Rude Things, Editorial Slangz, like Wu-Tang
And wild mood swings like catchin' a stick, or slappin' my bitch
Got me ready to flip on her, smelled dick on her
Cause I'm broke she found the next cat to trick on her
Not to mention, I heard it through the great vine
Niggas is after me, Thinkin' of blastin' me
Haterz speakin' all my name in Blasphemy
Gotta pack a gat now, Oh It's like that now
You copped P, You wanna strap now, it's bein' black now
You All Alone so whatcha Back Now

You All Alone in these streets
You All Alone, You All Alone

You All Alone, You All Alone
Betta keep ya eyes open and ya hand on the chrome

[Pikasoe Black]
Niggas better pay attention cuz the street got eyes
I'll be flippin' on your fam, and defeatin' your guys
You can't see the enemy, They dun bleached ya eyes
Reached yo pies, Touched you when you creeped on by
Niggas know around the corner is the seat that lies
Never go that route, why, cause we too wise
Brooklyn-I, 420 or 325, SLE, A-Class, What we tryin' to drive
Niggas strive for a mil, I want four point five
If you ride like I'm real than you walk them lines
New York Unkind, The fake niggas go and tell the jake niggas
Hit you for your do, and leave you in the lake nigga
You all alone in the streets, Better keep ya eyes open for these creeps
Thuggin', Sunk low in the Jeep Truck, and release slugs
Police Duckin', Lift you off your feet for frontin'
Jus peep streets is deep, End of Discussion

[TMR and Pikasoe Black]
You All Alone, You All Alone
You All Alone in these streets
You All Alone, You All Alone
You All Alone in these streets
You All Alone, You All Alone
Betta keep ya eyes open and ya hand on the chrome




I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four five seconds from wiling
And we got three more days til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday
Morning I swear
I wish somebody would tell me oo that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shining I'm positive
Then I heard you was talking trash
Hold me back I'm bout to smash
Now I'm four five seconds from wiling
And we got three more days til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday
Morning I swear
I wish somebody would tell me oo that's all I want
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinking how could I be so selfish
But you call about a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinking how could I be so reckless
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they wanna buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
Cause all of my kindness (yeah all of my kindness)
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four five seconds from wiling
And we got three more days til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday
Morning I swear
I wish somebody would tell me oo that's all I want
Four five seconds from wiling
And we got three more days til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday
Morning I swear
I wish somebody would tell me oo that's all I want




[Intro: Kanye West]
We in the streets, playa, get ya mail
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Two words, United States, no love, no breaks
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody move
Two words, Mos Def, K. West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody move
Two words, BK, NY, Bed Stuy
Too harsh, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Heavy traffic, one lane, everybody move
Two words, Mos Def, Black Jack, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game 'pon lock, gun 'pon cock
We won't stop, everybody move

[Chorus: Kanye West (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
(Throw your hands up high) Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
And keep ya hands up, hustlers
Busters, boosters, hoes ('Til they reach the sky)
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
'Cause I, rep that, 'til I fuckin' die
One neck two chains, one waist two gats
One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint five mics
Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"
Screamin', "Jesus, save me"
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's the only place to go now

[Chorus: Kanye West (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
(Throw your hands up high)
Oh, everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Two words, free way, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car, my God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
To brawl, forget ya squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words, "send for the law", uh
Two words, Freeway slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad

[Outro: Mos Def (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest
(High) And show it to 'em like




[Verse 1]
Look, let’s put some money up, you can’t make mine stop
I’m hot nigga, like a pistol off the dime block
Before you change lanes, you should check your blind spot
‘Cause I’ll be right there waitin’ like a bike cop
With my nine cocked, and I’m so hot
All a nigga really need is just one shot
To the dome, you be gone and it’s no more
I could kill ‘em goin’ fast or with the slow flow
Man I’m so O with the six in front
Motherfucka prolly smoke six blunts
Two o’s in the back, I got the six in front
Add four plus that, whatchu got, what’s what?
That’s a perfect ten, I’ma curse to him
Thinkin’ that the Slauson boys was not those men
I’ma knock those men out the ring by the third round
I treat it like the Superbowl, this is fourth down

[Chorus]
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough

[Verse 2]
It’s for the dough, the clothes
The bitches and the hoe’s
The paper in the cash, nigga used to livin’ fast
Navigation in my dash, big burner in my stash
Two twelves in my trunk, but nigga you don’t know the half
Look, ain’t nobody hold my hand through this shit
I was gave the same game, I just ran with this shit
On road to the riches, I don’t stand for no bitch
Caught herself for free when ridin’ with me
So It ain’t just MOB it’s MOE
That’s money-over-everything under G-O-D
I got A-1 credit, still its C.O.D
So keep it cash on deliver when you dealin’ with me
They wonder how a young nigga that’s as crooked as me
CEO of the label, no GED
See,I flow for them people that be in them streets
They seen me starve
Now they finna’ watch me eat

[Chorus]
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough

[Verse 3]
Look, off a fifth of that vodka-v, I’ma sick nigga
I’m dead up in the hood, livin’ like a rich nigga
I'd probably die in the hood cause of this nigga
I’m dead up in the hood, livin’ like a rich nigga
You’s bitch, you switch I’ma stay shitty
Win lose or draw, can’t take the pain with me
Said if I play the game, I gotta make my name history
Put it in the books, that nigga brought the flame with him
‘Cause where we go, nobody knows what’s coming after this
So while we’re here, let’s make a toast to all this lavish shit
Pop the Moe’ and pop the Vueve with the baddest bitch
Fast lane, young niggas just havin’ shit

[Chorus]
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough

[Outro]
When I go to sleep late I get off my grind
And when I wake up in the mornin’, money on my mind
‘Cause I’ma hustle




MODENINE - NIGGAZ IN PARIS FREESTYLE

Listen , im here for the shock value the mode will lyricute ya
Fashion police licence to kill dont let me shoot ya
The way you kids are dressed i predict an odd future
Your colors loud ya talking loud , i gots to double mute ya
Compulsive biting got em exposing their worn teeth
Youll be amazed when we meet call it corn beef
Maize meat corn beef
I kill em with share wit but wit cannot be physically shared
You gotta stool flow your baddest linewill not be cheered (chaired)
Carrot jeans and over 30 then we should be scared
Some artiste show me love in public like we really peers
But when i call em up for a track they diva uh that shit weird
Uh i scratch my temple thats kinda queer
Fuck em fuck em fuck em fuck em fuck em
Pardon my french but you can suck the cocks on six apes
Dont even need you anymore no fox and the grapes
Yes im hardcore and youre a limp biscuit
Your careers eeeeeeerrr you dont wanna risk it
Im a guerilla tyrant call me Ghengis Kong
You ain't trying to rap with me go sing a song
Man rap is on a low , thanks to Drake
And if you mad at that line - jump in a lake
Hiphop is undead we eating , Zombie feast
But you dead to me relationship now deceased
Give it the blindfold cigarette call a priest
Firing squad you a lap dog im a fucking beast
Fight the power like ten thousand Chuck D's
Your chick will go far , i gave her cock feed
The ones on their knees are likely to succeed (suck seed)
Pearl necklace hot beads for you skets and tarts
And you arseholes won't do shit you just fart
I love my haters Bazinga im giving them the finger




[Verse 1: Tyga]
I'ma make you love me, yeah, I'm your only hope
Listen to your momma, have a baby, he got dough
Don't go creepin' if ya got a iPhone
She tracked ya location and ya ass wasn't home
Yeah, I told the bitch like I told Nike: Yeezy's on yo' ass
Told that nigga get from and from my car
My Yeezy's on the gas
And last thing I need is involuntary manslaughter
'Cause I ain't finna let no lame nigga raise my daughter
Stop asking me that dumb shit; do you have a Samsung charger?
You see me spending that Gualla
We stay spending that Gualla 'til you love me
Thirsty bitch, keep sippin' that water 'till you love me
Do you love me?
I got caught up with the strippers, I got caught up in the fame
Caught up on MediaTakeOut
Don't know how much more I could take
I got caught up in the pictures, they blurry enough I could fake
I can tell my girl it wasn't me, I was in a meeting with Jay

[Bridge: Tyga]
But today, I don't have any plans
Rap God in a minivan
Usher say I got it bad, yo, really bad
Does anybody have any 'Xans?

[Verse 2: Tyga]
'Cause you don't know these rich-nigga problems
You niggas got bitch-nigga problems
Too many hoes on my dick; yeah, I got big dick nigga problems
If she hack my phone, that's dick pic nigga problems
That's when she ask, "Who the fuck is Tonya?"
Nigga, you must be fucking Tonya
Sometimes I do shit to prove I don't need nothin' from 'em
Sometimes I make 'em hate me just to prove I can make 'em love me again
I could make you love me again
I'll make y'all love me
I feel like a new artist up in this bitch
Like I'm really starving up in this bitch
If you don't wanna hear my mouth, don't get me started up in this bitch
Every time I throw up my diamond, see it's flawless up in this bitch
Screaming south-southside, goin' retarded up in this bitch
See T-Raww up in this bitch
Yeah, see Yeezus back on his shit
They say damn Ye, please come back
We need more of the platinum hits
Bitch my new boot killed that Timberland
My niggas don't remember them
I'm the dark chocolate Eminem
I'ma make you love me

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Tyga (both)]
You see love and hate's a similar emotion
Opposite of love is the difference
That's when motherfuckers don't care about you no more
I'd rather be hated and loved than be not cared about
Rrrrra, rrrrrrra, get these motherfuckers out
See I immediately took the media
See I immediately took the media
And made it what it mean to me
I control this shit, I control the puppet strings
I am in charge of the narrative
So don't ever compare this shit
As I air this shit out, a modern day Ali
For anybody that wanna try me, see
All I ever wanted to do was take the whole time on TV and give an eleven-minute speech
They wish I would perform for these niggas
Dance. nigga. dance, dance, nigga, dance, dance, nigga, dance
I been dancing too long and y'all motherfuckers money been getting too strong
If I hear another motherfucker I put on made a million dollars a day (uh, yeah, yeah)
(Fuck [?] all these hoes, I'ma make you love me, yeah)
If I hear another motherfucker I put on made a million muhfuckin' dollars a day (uh, yeah, yeah)
(Them boys just don't know, I'ma make you love me, yeah)
(Hit me on my phone, I can't hear them other girls 'cause I got them hoes on hold)
If I say, I say (I'ma make you love me, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I'ma make you love me (yeah, yeah-yeah)
I'ma make you love me (yeah, yeah-yeah)
You never stopped loving me, did you?
(I'ma make you love me, yeah)
You never stopped loving me. did you?




[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 1: Twista & New Birth]
Ain't no way that you could pull up to the party
In a Bentley blowing B, gettin' club like this (Oh no)
Ain't no way that you could cook up in the studio
With Kanye and get it jukin' in the club like this
(Oh no, impossible) Ain't no way that you gon' win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin' on my Henn
Holla at a chick while she sippin' on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollerin' at her friends
(It's impossible) For you to ever be the nicest
You won't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't never stood on a tip like this
You ain't never stood for no shit like this
(It's just impossible) For you to get it if you don't wanna win
Get up off yo' ass and go for yours, I'm goin' for mine
Now you ain't from the ride what I'm in, know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 2: Twista & New Birth]
It's impossible for you to ever get with me
Because of how I ride on the track
Got the bitch in the back of the Bentley [?]
Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac
(It's just impossible) Niggas always hatin'
Even before I came out with [?]
You be sittin' back and be talkin' your shit
I can't help but I see you though, I don't get it
(It's impossible) Lil' mama, for you to fit all that ass in them jeans
Movin' kinda wilder, turnin' regular jeans into low riders
Tell me, can I be your man?
(It's just impossible) For you to ever deny that I'm about Chi-Town
Represent the city with the deal for twelve years
And sell a couple of mil' and still hold it down, that's impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 3: Kanye West & New Birth]
Get it, roll the weed up and lit it
Smoke a little but don't admit it
Do it like I did, too late, I did it (It's just impossible)
The controversy can't worse me, man
I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty, what is you sayin'?
I got a duel with a couple niggas, that's Thursday, man
Why the hell is I'm worryin'?
Hoppin' out the Benz with the perfect 10
"Man, your life must be perfect, man
Look at how they came up with the perfect plan"
(It's just impossible) It's impossible
Got strip clubs playin' gospitel, flow so sick in the hospital
You know I jammed out like 'Pac'll do
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did shit on Logical
Maybe 'cause we did the impossible
Baby, we done did the impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Outro: New Birth]
It's impossible
It's just impossible
It's impossible




[Verse 1]
I told you I don't want you all the time
Cause you're not mine
I'm not in love, but I'm in like
So far it's working fine
But when I need you then I'm desperate
I'm a little child
Just like an animal, down on my knees and beggin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

[Post-Chorus]
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

[Verse 2]
I'm in my bed, and I'm obsessed
I'm lying wide awake
I need someone like you to come
And put me in my place
Cause in the day, I can't be tamed
Boy, you don't wanna know
But in the night, my hands are tied
You tell me where to go

[Chorus]
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

[Post-Chorus]
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

[Bridge]
Rock me now
Rock me now

[Chorus]
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

[Outro]
You and me, sitting on a tree
You be the daddy, I'll be the baby




[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right For The Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Hook]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but

'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH

[Beat changes to Lil Jon's version]

Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day, every day fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that's for the A-Town
What y'all sayin'?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna stand and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

[Hook]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out

Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Phonte]
Yeah, what up? It's Phonte, Phontigga
I gotta take time to address 'em
Kanye, I know you understand where I'm comin from baby
Uh, all you non-believing motherfuckers - this is for y'all

[Hook: Phonte]
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
They gon' download it nigga, they can't wait for that
But I don't care if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
To see me fall off my nigga, they can't wait for that
But I'mma do what I feel like
Three albums in the game muh'fucker, we still tight

[Phonte]
Yo, let me get into it
Stop all the fame and applause
And name callin at them famous award shows
Nigga that's just brainless and Lord knows
What would happen if I wasn't rappin for them lost souls
Who feel that Hip Hop's at the crossroads
And miss that type of shit that they can feel in they torsos
I wish this shit was easy, oh not so
Even the road less travelled is littered with potholes
And booby traps, 'Te is more than hot flows and booty raps
But, niggas who missed their shot can't seem to handle that
So, they hate on us like Soviets
But we keep them niggas in check like Wachovia
And it ain't over yet
Cause hater niggas marry hater bitches and y'all know the rest
Yes... stop your crying baby

[Hook: Phonte]
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
They gon' download it nigga, they can't wait for that
But I don't care if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
To see me fall off my nigga, they can't wait for that
But I'mma do what I feel like
Three albums in the game muh'fucker, we still tight

[Phonte]
You know the feelin when your hard workin
Hustlin pays off (pays off), pays off (pays off)
And you can finally get all your credit cards paid off (paid off), paid off
Nigga they got hate for that, lately I've been takin my time
Tryna sit back and chill, get away from the grind
For the sake of my rhymes, and the sake of my flows
Got your girl in here naked steady touchin her toes
Like them porno hoes, what would you do for a threesome?
I mean a Halle Berry, Sanaa Lathan and Free-some
Oooh they have love for that
They might show up raw dog with no glove for that
'Te, your check'll be there on Monday
Three months later, your check'll be there on Monday
That shit ain't funny, I ain't no dummy
Fuckin with my money, do I need to call my niggas Big Dho or Dunny?
I know y'all hatin and I hope y'all hear this
I don't give a goddamn, y'all can just keep starin
Yeah, uh

[Hook: Phonte]
They got hate for that, they ain't gon' pay for that
So much hate I know they probably hate this track
But I don't care if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop
They got hate for that, they can't wait for that
Found this loop like "Damn, 'Ye got payed for that"
I don't give a damn if our shit flop
It's dope beats, dope rhymes, nigga that's Hip Hop




Sitting on a runway, time on my hands, thinking of you again
As I replay our conversations, pray that everything fell in place
Like a mirror lookin' back at me, sayin' you're the only one
Makin' me feel I could survive, so glad to be alive
Nowhere to run, I got a song to sing
Messed up inside and it's been raining all day

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade

[Bridge]
South-south-southside, southside
South-southside, southside
South-southside

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade
South-south-southside

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Excuse me but this verse
Has not been Russell Simmons approved uh-uh
You won't see it on Run's house uh-uh
You won't see it at a nun's house
My New York nigga said he heard it at son's house
Talkin' 'bout how this ho is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois, maybe I'm just bogus
Cause she don't wan't you to buy her a drank
Swizz said she ain't got no money in the bank
And she be standin' there, cause it's cameras
Tryin' to show yo legs off, you ain't Amerie
If I fall in love, a girl gon' live on rodeo
Until that day-o, she take the monorail
And I don't want no girl that will answer to "ayo"
Make it more harder, make me put some work in
You get to flirtin', play her just perfect
Fuck a drank, I'mma buy tha bar if ya worth it

[Verse 2 - T-Pain]
Baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drink
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy, ooh wee
I know the club close at three
What's the chance of you rollin' wit me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Lets get drunk, forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah


[Verse 3 - T-Pain]
Talk to me, I talk back
Lets talk money, I talk that
Crunk Juice Bombs, Oakley Shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Lets get gone, walk it out (walk it out)
Just like that, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gone have fun, you gone see
On that Patrón, you should get like me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah

[Bridge - T-Pain][x2]
Lets get gone

(Now walk it out think 'bout it, aaahhh snap!)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self
Lets get gone
Walk it out
(Now walk it out think 'bout it, aaahhh snap!)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah




[Intro]
That girl looking good over there man. What should I do?

[Kanye]
It's your big brother Kanye To The. And I know how you feel about shawty. Man, I was going through the same thing when I was your age

[Young Leek]
I got you

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm just saying
This is where you should be
Girl let him know that he alright but
You wanna rock with me
Let it go
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Come and let me
Give you what you need
Girl don't play
Send him on his way
Come ride with me

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
And the party was just so tense is
But all this waiting around is just so senseless
And I've been calling her phone so relentless
Mama said the phone bill was so expensive
Your eyes slanted like Lucy Liu
You're frank couture to the juicy suit
Your lips sweater than a Juicy Fruit
From your Louie Vuitton bag to your Gucci boots
Whether we on a train or a two seat Coupe
I'mma fiend for you like Pookie do
I was there with [?] Whoopty Woo
She was there with her man, some goofy dude
And I ain't really trying to be rude to dude
All I need is a change to advance, take my hand
Understand from a dance I could end up your man
If I'd been scared wouldn't have seen her again
Oh

[Hook]




[Verse 1: Carl Thomas]
Now I can't sit here and act like, my girl ain't...
Never did nothin' for me
No
But right now she's just not the same...
Woman she used to be
And I tried to explain how I feel
But she just don't know what it takes
No, no
So I'mma take whatever time that I have...
And give it to you

[Chorus]
(Cause my baby don't love me)
The way that you do
Takin' time hangin' out, bangin' out
Gotta give it to you
(Cause my baby don't love me)
The way that you do
So from now on
My love is for you

[Verse 2: Carl Thomas]
Now I ain't gonna sit and complain how she never would cook or clean
Never would cook or clean
Oh, no
If it wasn't for Christmas or my Birthday
She never bought me a thing
Never bought me a thing
But she had the nerve to turn around and ask me for a ring
No, but instead I might just turn it around and give it to you

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Ever since I been flossin'
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They don't breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold, Steve Austin
Claim that I boss 'em
Basically Diana Ross 'em
But who's to blame for all these fights
When you ain't always wrong
I'm just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I ain't the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Let's talk about amnesia
Yeah you got that bad
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And I'm the best version of Mase next to Fab
And I'mma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do

[Carl Thomas]
...

[Kanye West]
Shoutout to John Monopoly, Whoo Kid




[Couplet 1: Kanye West]
Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Harmonizing]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Couplet 2: Kanye West]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Caroline Shaw]
I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song, this song could play and could come true
I wish this song, "Say You Will," would come true
I wish this song
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
I admit I, don't say, I admit I, don't say I admit I

[Chorus: Kanye West & Caroline Shaw]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I admit I, I admit I
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Say you will, say you will
Don't say I, don't say I
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

[Instrumental Outro]




[Intro]
I hear you, I hear you, L-Boogie
Remember they used to call you that?
What you say, Lauryn?
You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down
(Oh when it all)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?
Couldn't have got nobody better for the job
Thank you very much this a beautiful
Beautiful young lady that's inspired me definitely




[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleep (Less in June) or (Missing you)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

[Instrumental Outro]




[Intro: Bon Iver]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gon' do now?"
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West, Jay Z & both]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop

[Intro: Etta James]
You make me smile with my heart, ohh

[Hook: Kanye West, Etta James]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But You make me smile

[Verse 1: Kanye West, Etta James]
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs (You make me smile)
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca-Cola (You make me smile with my heart, ohh)
Then I'm co-coming over cause it's ne-never over

[Hook: Kanye West, Etta James]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But You make me smile

[Verse 2: Kanye West, Etta James]
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed (You make me smile)
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola (You make me smile with my heart)
And I keep co-coming over cause it's ne-never over

[Hook: Strings, Etta James]
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could

[Hook: Kanye West, Etta James]

[Outro: Kanye West]
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, ok, ok (You make me smile with my heart)
Well I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)




[Intro: Four Tops]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

[Verse: Kanye West & T.I.]
I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit…
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me."
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

[Outro: Kanye West]
Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?




[Verse 1]
What it, what it
What it is cu cuz
What it is fo folk
I’ve been watchin’ you from over here on the other side of the club lookin’ at’chu all through that
Smoke
What do you drank, -drank
Little Patron, a little Grey Goose, a little Hennessey
But when I see you, all my girls like “What do you—
“Thank?”
“How do you feel,-feel?”
Butterflies running all up and down my chest but he’s so hot to death and I’m Sophia Fresh and that’s
Real
What am I suppose to do?
Get up and walk to a th-iz-ug and act like I'm innocent and cute?
Nah, I’mma step like

[Hook]

Have you ever been down wit a female from the hood?
She can really make you feel good an’ make you sang
Hop in a Maserati, baby boy, we can roll
All I really wanna know is…

What it is du-dude?
I see you in your C-A-D-I
Double L while the A-C blows so
Cule
How does it ride –ride?
24s on the back wit a fifth 24 on the back
Twenty hits on a lac truck back up to a
Glide
Super high from the ground
I feel like I’m an alien in a UFO
Somebody better beam me up back on down
What else am I suppose to do?
Get up an’ walk to a th-iz-ug and act like im innocent and cute?
Haha, I’mma step like…

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, I don’t need no little ass
I need a ghetto ass
Girl wit a little car that can make it cross town wit just a little gas
I know when we first met
You was a little gassed
But you wanna keep your swag
So you was holdin’ back
Yo’ little brotha luv me
He say “Yeezy got some fresh clothes”
Yo’ grandmother luv me ‘cause I always dress in dress clothes
I can switch yo’ dress code
Change your life like “Presto”
I am like that aston martin engine, you just press “Go”
Why –why you ac’in’ like you ain’t impressed for?
Oh, see, why you listen to the press, though?
I-I-ain’t fitta ‘splain my life up on no Larry King ‘cause when I show her that thing, she say
“That explains everything”
“Everything”
“That just changed everything”
Yeezy on her name ring
Yeezy with her chain bling
Yea I throw Barack up, but
Baby, you get my vote
Love a ghetto girl
With more ass than the models
(See-see-see I did the-the skrewed up shit myself)
(I didn’t put no effect, no – you know)




[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and quit playin' with that bitch

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & (Kanye West)]
Too fresh, man, to be a class clown
Graduated when I sat down
They don't want you to show your ass
Had the Yeezy spazzes in the background (bitch)
Let's talk about the Raf now
Let's talk about the stash now
Hella niggas send my ho's up
All you bitches get passed down (bitch)
Every now and then, on the Act, wow
Maybe sing a little, bitch, I'm act wild
Bitches rubbing on me like a frat child
On London town, bitches packed down (bitch)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man you got to hate it
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated
Man, I'm underrated, over-overstated
Rappin' over thirty, talkin' out related
That's captivated, Grammy nominated
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man I'm motivated
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated




[Intro: Kanye West, Andy Kaufman & Andy Kaufman's Grandmother]
Yeah, I'm a creative genius
And there's no other way to word it
I know you're not supposed to say that about yourself
And I say things the wrong way a lot of times
But my intention is always positive
"You're... you're a genius, you really are
You're a genius"
I know

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Ohhhhhhh
Run my, run my, run my head (Yeah)
Run my, run my, run my head (Yeah)
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Ohhhhhhh

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Black ski, gold teeth
Goatee, fingerless
Blasphemous, wrists are slit
I kissed the bitch
Blood on my lips
Cold as shit
He scarred the bitch
I grabbed her bra, and tell her she can
She can, she can (Yeah)

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Run my, run my, run my head, yeah
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Oh no...

[Outro: Diane Birch]
Cause honey we just love to sing the blues
So listen up this one's for you




Let’s go, let’s go, let’s

[Verse 1]
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

[Hook]
As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? (Flashing lights)

[Verse 2]
I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though: yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't roam without Caesar

[Hook x2]

You know, I’m ‘sposed to talk about what some of these songs mean
And some of the stuff is so personal to me
And some of the things I’ve been through is so real
In the form that I’m ‘sposed to break down certain things
And this is one of the first times, because I feel like I’m placed in front of the audience right now
And uhm, certain things are just hard for me to talk about
And I’m sorry VH1 for that
But it uhm, certain things are too serious

And I stand before you, just a human being trying to improve under the microscope
Just the star of the Truman show
As every day I take as calculated
Every time I put on my shoes
Under the flashing lights

Just got an email today
A new book coming out
Doctor Adams: the Truth about Donda West
What the media doesn’t want you to know

And you know, now that my momma passed
Would she really want me to put myself in a situation where I go to jail?
FOR KILLING ‘EM

Under the flashing lights
And the public perception
Where I feel like I’m always in defense of myself
And I realize that I’ve made some mistakes, but I grow from them
It’s like I’m fighting to be me, but I have to leave the fight
‘Cause it helps everyone else be who they wanna be

That’s a story for your ass…

Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Back (back) to the heavens I fell from

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
My father named me Cydel
My momma pushed out a diamond
Took out the del off my name and put the H-I behind it
That's CY-HI short for your HIghness
Then I added The Prynce
So you know where my mind is
My sister asked me when I'm goin' to get married
When it's affordable to get my wife six carats
Supposed to have a brother but my mother had a miscarriage
So every blessing he was supposed to get i'll inherit
I really wanted to be an athlete
So, it's the Olympics every time me and the track meet
I'm so ahead of my time I'm finna lap me
I know the Lord is Thy Shepherd though I'm the black sheep
I ain't gotta act street you can ask V
It was nothing to get off of key
Like a wack beat
I hit the gas let the 'lac creep
My partner riding shotgun same thing was in the back seat
I ain't worried bout niggas sayin' I'm wack
Cuz when I was in the traps
Some niggas really tried to wack me
Ya don't really know the feeling
Prynce ain't from Queens
But I've seen supreme dope dealing
King pin shit in this ring there's no squealing
Disciplined gangsters no women no children
At the age of nineteen I had the coupe no ceiling
Selling fruit while I'm bumping number two Lord Willin
If I ever make a million
I don't want to lose it all; Curt Schillings
I got a homie who didn't deserve prison
Tried to tell him that the man he killed wasn't worth killing
But that's the life of a young goon
When it rains it pours caught in a monsoon
I'm hoping that his day come soon
Memories of us rapping beatin' on the table in the lunchroom

[Hook]
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Back (back) to the heavens I fell from

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
Cydel Young homie I'm seldom
Seen in the club because i go to sleep like at 12 sumthin'
I used to sell plums
I'm used to the bail bonds
Man you niggas actin' like going to jail's fun
When Butchy got shot I instantly felt numb
We was like fifteen when we first held guns
But beef can get you killed though
At least for twenty years when you gotta lot at stake
It's gotta be well done
Tales from a place where ain't no fair ones
This my gift from God my nigga you welcome
A buncha rappers bootleggin' my rhymes
These niggas tryinta illegally sell rum
But they liquor is cheap
Rapping like I’m in a gym
Working on my figure of speech
I'm going back to the original me
Back before all my friends shitted on me
Playin' sideline bus in the middle the street
Before my girlfriend became a miserable freak
One man's trash is another man's treasure
And I mean that, literally
I was cool with the killers and thieves
Got black eyes from fist fights they tried to Forest Whitaker me
But I survived shorty I survived
I knew I would be famous my nigga I'm not surprised
Came a long way from hamburgers and apple pies
I was so broke sometimes I couldn't ask for fries
But I knew that God had a plan for me
All the problems in my life made a man of me
Took three bags to my folks at Scott-dale
Came back with like twenty grand on me
Call me watcha want
Just don't put your hands on me
I'm Cyhi but everybody on Redan know me as

[Hook]
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Cydel Young they feel me in Belgium
And when I die I'm going back to the heavens I fell from
Back to the heavens I fell from
Back (back) to the heavens I fell from




[Intro]
This my last motherfuckin' freestyle dog
If you don't let me go first this time man, you'll have to wait 'til the album come out Monday
I'm tired man I'm sick and tired
I'm just a player player
Plus it's an exclusive KanyeToThe beat? C'mon man
Fuck around throw this on your instrumental shit too
This is what I'mma have to say

[Verse]
Niggas old as hell, trying to get they rapping on
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
I'm in the club, posted up, "Guess Who's Back" is on
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world, we all got your girl
Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back
They like "Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back!"
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins
Niggas popping out the woodworks, talking about "you owe me"
Mama, I'm famous, niggas hate me that don't know me

[Outro]
Yo, I know you all suprised and shit when you see me on MTV
But keep your eyes glued to...I don't know what channel that is out here
In Chicago that's Channel 7, ABC
You might fuck around see me on Oprah Winfrey or something
Matter of fact, true story, true story
Last week...I got a little cold right now, true story, though
I'm on 40th and like 5th or something
I see an SUV and the window rolled down and shit!
And this black lady from Chicago, she like
"Yo, um, I just bought one of these in black."
You know I just got the G5 or whatever
She like, "I just got one of these in black
How does it drive?"
I'm like, "it drive more like a truck than my last one."
I'm like, "yo, but I'm from Chicago, too. I wanna be on your show!"
She said "yo, well, oh, ok, well, who are you?"
And I told her, "I'm Kanye West, a rapper."




[Intro: Refrain]
That old fashioned word
It's a word called love
Called looooove
Called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me
Y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hating

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)]
(Some people hate) Don't tell me niggas is hating
(Some people hate) Uhh, nah, you know what I think?
(Some people hate) I think...
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A payment for brushes with police officers
A peace offering from the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)]
(Some people hate) Yeah
(Some people hate) Uh, uh, uh
(Some people hate) Yeah! You know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit
Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
They try to take me out the game but I's alive
It's like a old Negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life
It's either that or y'all gon' make me
Put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)]
(Some people hate)
(I know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out)
(Some people hate) Jealousy is a weak emotion, man
(Some people kill their brothers)
C'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be alright though

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit
By riding out when niggas had learners' permit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
Turn your six, I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
Run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
And then we coming where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look

[Outro: Sample]
Some people hate
Some people hate
Some people kill their brothers
I think they've lost their minds
And I'm hung up.. ohh..




[Intro]
Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good

[Verse 1]
Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
Could of lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, " Do ya got a man?"
She said,"No", he said, "Oh yeah
Where do you stay?" She said, " Rosecrans"
Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck
He said, "What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?"
She said, "Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk."
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with

[Hook]
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead

[Verse 2]
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you don't use it
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit

[Hook]
And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?




[Intro]
Yo, this that shit
Just to let niggas know
You can’t fuck with us

[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
Sit down nigga, I know the game
Clothes shopper, I know the game
Take it and put it back into the store
Crazy cat, ah
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed

[Verse 1]
Got me talkin bout love, you mean forever
You mean me falling in love, talking never
She’s missing me after this one chick got together
She told me she had a man but they not together
Let me tell you how I first met her
It’s kinda ill though
I’m downtown tryna find Anita
That’s where I find this diva stand in front the hospital
I double park the car, scream, yo man’s not with you
As for the cigarettes just brought the convo what went on
I man up and eat, her belly holdin on
And as far as she say
Oh that was over, he say she say
So you telling me your man stayed up in micro weeds
Mistaken identity like Cochise and I’m finna be
Holla at you now, know we’ll talk later
And I wanna get up but you got flavor
Now I’ma let you get the cell, let you get the pager
And if you ain’t around no haters you can call me later

[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
Y’all know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game

[Verse 2]
She must’ve known where the dollars at
Cause it ain’t taken long at all but need to holla back
Gave me directions to the crib, told me follow that
And I could park in back where the Impala at
But she ain’t stayed on the southside, south southside
Deeper than the know when
Now I’m questioning whether I should get in that
Plus lasting a lot, walk into the door, haters asking a lot
And where you from nigga? You ain’t from round here
As I peeped out the window said baby I’m right here
He mad cause I’m with her and he ain’t with her
And he stayed down the hallway and he can’t get er
So when I came out the nigga hatin on me was waitin on me
And he had mo guys, no lie
Man I knew we were both wrong, bitch but I know nothing
Finna wear both chains but I know nothing

[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game




[Intro: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Doesn't get much better than that (Nah!)
So unfair, so.. unfair advantage
(Yo, it doesn't feel much better than that)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's the dream, it's Kobe and Jordan on the same team
In the best prime of their game and the same Kanye
You know the name and it's not pronounced Kane
And every time, you know I spit that flame
Ayo we gettin' out our dreams, gettin' out our dreams
And we gonna buy some things, and we got him out of Queens
Talkin' 'bout my man Consequence, once for the Tribe
Talkin' 'bout my man GLC and now he's around
Talkin' 'bout John Legend, take 'em all the way to Heaven
Speakin' of Heaven, Common speaks the heavenly words
The nouns and verbs and whatever you heard
Whatever synonym, we killin' 'em, everybody feelin' him
The people's choice, the people's champ like Paul Wall
All haters, I gotta say fuck all y'all
No, I won't waste my energy no more
I have to be more concerned about Sierra Leone
I'm talkin' 'bout people that's dyin' for diamonds
And the way that uh
They got uh, capa
What I want to say, monopoly over the country
And every time you say somethin' people act funky
The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day
And might only get paid two cups of rice a day
Is this the price to pay for the icy way?
We like to floss away, even your boy 'Ye
With my Jesus piece, I gave diamonds to my niece
If I had a brother, Kanye, Common made "I Used to Love H.E.R."
Used to love her and I still do, lyrically I kill you
Dog I don't feel you, your style is like mildew
Real old, I'm real cold, listen to this beat, real soul
Your style is real old, dollar bill fold
Stackin' money ain't funny, and I'm out in UK
And I ask 'em who's the best, and they say "you K"
Ooh way ooh way
Yeah I feel it and I gotta kick it off the top of the dome
Microphone controller, that's an M.C., it's in me
I can lead a crowd, I went to your show, it's empty
Go to my shit, it's sold out, every single seat
Every time I drop, because like Shaq, I bring the heat
And anybody that freestyle on the level that I do
Should be winnin' Grammys too
So if you do it like me, you can do it like this
And uh, they say I'm a teacher like the one called Kris
That's KRS but nah it's Kanye West
And every time I spit the rhymes, uh straight off the flesh
I could bring it down to the bone straight from the heart
And from the heart is where I did it 'fore I ever chart
And then I spit it, we get it, we did it, we do it a lot
Kanye spit it, we do it, we makin' it hot
I got patterns like Saturn, the rings, the rings
Uh, Gold Digger, that's the single, the single
Gotta hit the club just to mingle, to mingle
Why you all in my face? I'm tryna do my thing dude
Back off, I'll have Barry smack the fuck out of you
Everybody wanna know what they can get out you
Aww here's my demo, dawg, here's my group
Dawg, please back me up, you're heated up, you're soup
Y'all gassed, I passed, I flow, I rhyme
I'm uh, that's the way, that yah boy gotta shine
Straight from the Chi city, everybody ride with me
And you see the same questions and I gotta teach the lesson
This some, this some sick freestylin', I hear you're readin' it
I gotta keep goin' cause y'all fans, y'all needin' it
Uh, you say I'm too high like I smoke weed in it
And they say "he arrogant, he's always conceited, shit"
Well what you want from me? Y'all just can't stop me
You could look in my pants and tell that I'm cocky

[Bridge 1: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
(Laughing)
(Oh my God, Oh my God)
(Damn) Yeah
We back, we back like we ever left, huh
(Crazy!)
Like we ever left, huh, like we e', like we ever left, huh
Like we ever left, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Kanye on the Westwood Tour
Chillin' with Westwood
Go to Chicago, that's Kanye West's hood
And the label called G.O.O.D
Should I holla at these bitches? You should
You might need one, you might need one
You might fuck one
If you eat out like McDonald's
I ain't no clown like Ronald
Uh, more like Donald
Trump, with the way I get it crunk
Like my man Lil Jon, but call him Lil Kan'
He all the same, flow like Lil Wayne on Tha Carter
And I'm signed to the Carter faculty
'Cause the Roc is in back of me
Actually, that look like stacks to me
Ch-ching, ch-ching
Yah nahmean, yah nahmean, I'm doin' my thing
Out in U.K., London
And they call me number one
Japan, you're number one
That's Ichiban
And I learned that from KRS-One
Won once again like One
Like Puff, my friend, and One
One, give me one of them
Talkin' 'bout one drink, one hand
One cup of Henny, one cup of Hypno
If you ran out of it, yo, you got to get more
And I might sip slow but I never sip Mo
I sip Cris-o, Cris-y-Cris
And I gotta break it down like Missy Miss
She had the "hee hee, who got the keys?"
You don't need that if you got the no start V
Where you push the button, that ain't nothin'
All y'all talkin' somethin', y'all stay frontin'
Kanye dropped the beats to get 'em jumpin'
Lucifer, top of the morning to yah
Cheerio, hit up the flow, bring it back, oh
From Chicago, uh
And I'm rockin' the Dolce Gabbana
Fashionable persona
GQ, who knew he'd be the flyest?
Like T.W.A.C.W.K
K.A.N.Y W.E.S.T
Be the B.E.S.T

[Bridge 2: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
You know, I'mma stop it right there
(Laughs) I just, I just feel like
I 'on't know if I feel like rappin' right now
(Oh my God!)

I got raps for yah, uh huh
I got raps for yah
I got, uh, I got raps for yah
We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
Uh, uh
I 'on't know, I 'on't know what
I got so many joints right know, runnin' through my head
I 'on't even know what to yeah
What should, what should I spit?
I could just freestyle off of these messages
Please can you tell
Okay this is a girl writin' this
Please can you tell my uh, boyfriend Danny
That I love him loads, with all my heart
And I can't wait to see him tomorrow

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
She can't wait to see you tomorrow Danny
She love you, mhmm
You know what that mean?
You gonna get some
I wonder if she gon' be wearin' one of those tight outfits
And you know that I like that shit
I ain't sayin' I ever met her but come on
You must be pimpin' and you ain't sweat her, you know?
She writin' you on one of these hip-hop shows
Made me wonder if she's a hip-hop ho
No disrespect, you know
I don't know you so
I will not disrespect, so don't please press eject
On the tape cassette, and don't knock it out of your decks
So with much respect, obliged, when I rhyme
Sometimes some things just pop out, sometimes
I must be a, I forgot the medical name
Not a narcoleptic that be sleepin'
How people was sleepin' when I made it deeper
And I gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it
Uh, they call me Rockafella's best little secret
Uh, I got the beats for the Jeep
When people used to rock Amigo's and Suzuki's
And the Isuzu's, this the way you flow
Do flow, aye yo you just like Menudo
Played out about mad years ago
And uh, I could rock off the top, I got years of flow
I got so many albums to go, at least about seven
Jesus Walks had me all the way
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Yo that's where the line's at
Look at my shows, look how long that the line's at
All the way to the back, sold out, one night
That's the way it is when you done it right
Take time to drop a album, don't just be buyin' beats from everybody
Cause everybody ain't got it, I got it
I get it, I only give it to those who really live it
Like Jay-Z, the Game, and my dogs that really did it
Like Kweli, like Common, like dudes that really spit it
I'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it
And as far as makin' your songs, it's all wrong
You be doin' everything that everybody else is on
Man, I'mma break it down, let me take it down
Here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin'
Look, you take the crack concept
And you do that 'til it's all dead and gone, you do it all wrong
Now uh, you take the car concept
And I see it every video, every single place I go
Same shit

[Bridge 3: Kanye West (Tim Westwood)]
Man you know the beat ran out on me
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna break down
(That was mean, that was mean!) I was gonna break down to people
Exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change
(Let's go, let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First of all, what you need's a beat from me
If you can't get a beat from me, get a beat from your guy
He'll prolly do it for free
And if he do it like [?] he'll prolly do it for E
And if he do [?], he'll prolly do it for skeet
Yo, yo-yo, yo-yo-yo, you gotta bring with your flow
You gotta take it on-beat and off-beat
And don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats
You know that real hard shit, regardless, I played my part in this
Like, this Corner beat, this what you want when you want a beat
And that's when you really is gonna be
A hip-hop legend like Kan, like Kan
Like, of course the Louis Vuitton, 'ton, don, don
If I do say so, myself
And I do all the time, every rhyme
Cause I'm, I'm feelin' myself
And if you was me, you'd be feelin' yourself, you see
If you out in London, you just hopped on a plane
And you just came out of the bathroom, you just got you some brain
Uh, you doin' your thing
And plus you flossin' that Rocafella chain
Aye yo, you know you let Kan spit on 'em
I'm rockin' the Rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em
Oh, oh
Now let me bring it back to the flow, flow
And how you make the album and you make some dough, dough
Get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up
Fuck your name up
And uh, if you've been runnin' to a [?]
Trade your chain for some studio time
See a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to
A lot of people want club records they wanna dance to
A lot of people want basslines, they will enhance you
Bass in the club is good too, what you should do
Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
And if you don't know her, holla at Alicia please
You know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids
Actin' like they got it made
[?] you give a dawg with a fade
You get somebody that's weak, you get somebody that you know can't flow
And you rap before him, and let him go
And people gon' be like well least you was better than dude
And [?] I don't mean to be rude
And another thing you can do
If you could channel the spirits like I channel
I'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles, I'm not talkin' sayonce
I'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to God, I mean just like once
What I do before I rhyme, every day is I pray
I pray to God that he make these songs in a certain way
I let him speak through me, through the beats, through the music
I mean, sometimes I go into the booth and lose it
I mean, I know he speakin' when I freak it in it a way
That I coulda never thought of somethin' better to say
So, our father, who art up above us
I know any time we fuck, you still love us
Like when I'm cursin' in my verses and I even do, what's worse is
When I'm spendin' too much, spendin' on purses
And shoes for my girl when I should be helpin' the world
Give back to the charity, he still don't embarrass me
He still let me be, He still keep it real
See that's the thing about humans, we got free will
See the angels gotta do exactly what God want 'em to do
God is still with you, even when we don't do
So, follow the path, follow the laws
Follow the reason, the reasons why it's wrong
You never heard a freestyle like this before-'fore
And I know that hip-hop fans want more

[Outro: Kanye West]
Westwood, what's good
Holla at your boy, Kanye the Louis Vuitton Don
The Roca stay, buildin'
Yeah, it's G.O.O.D. Music baby
After you freestyle like that you just talk shit for about eight minutes

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

Lyrics from snippets

[Intro: Andrea Bocelli]
Por ti volaré
Espera que llegaré
Mi fin de trayecto eres tú
Para vivirlo-

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Like the mindblower, watchin' what we don't want
Whole family here, but it feel like a movie
Feel like a movie, yeah, it feel like a movie
Whole family here, but it feelin' like a-

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We so living so Italian (What?), living so Italian (What?)
Living so Italian (What?), I said living so Italian (What?)
Living so Italian (Nah), living so Italian (What?)
Living so Italian, I said living so Italian

[Verse: JAY-Z]
Hov keep gettin' that dinero, got it
Even if a nigga gotta rob it, get it?
Black Jack in a casino
A nigga got unlimited credit, uh
A nigga got a lot of vendettas, uh
But we the Black mob, we gonna set it, uh
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach
200 in the dash, we gonna rev it, skrt
Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano
A 100 keys at the piano
Plays across the Verrazano
El Padrino, in the villa in Venice, sippin' vino
Not bad for a mulignan
Y'all know like we know, ha

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We so living so Italian (What?), living so Italian (What?)
Living so Italian (What?), I said living so Italian (What?)
Living so Italian (Nah), living so Italian (What?)
Living so Italian, I said living so Italian




[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, we got the black elite in the house tonight
Rosewood
I feel like I'm at the NAACP or something right now
The Essence Festival
Q-Tip on the beat too, uh, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe 'cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the frontin'?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
I swear life's a bitch on her period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me, tell I ain't fuck what nobody think
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Question:
What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered
In the 1800s; y'all forget that
I got called "nigga" on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away, hanh! Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, "Peace!"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust

[Verse 4: Consequence]
That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, "You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man"
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
"Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should




Announced today, Kanye West‘s creative house DONDA enters into partnership with Roc Nation to manage all DONDA Music

The partnership will focus on Mr. West’s international recording brand and worldwide touring ventures

A multi-discipline design and content company, DONDA saw its early beginnings seeded by the 2009 footwear collaboration with fashion house Louis Vuitton. That collaboration spurred demand for Mr. West’s design sensibilities with fashion and apparel brands around the globe, including Nike and Adidas. DONDA continues its influence in the world of apparel: two versions of the Nike AIR YEEZY – each of which has sold out worldwide in just minutes – two celebrated capsule lines with Parisian brand A.P.C. – also instantly sold-out – and the highly-anticipated new line with Adidas, slated to debut this fall

Mr. West officially branded DONDA in 2011 with the groundbreaking packaging and tour design for Watch The Throne. The following year, DONDA conceptualized and introduced an immersive new way to experience cinema: the 7-Screen Surround Vision experience in Cannes, France. The short film Cruel Summer, a visual companion to the G.O.O.D. Music album of the same name, employed the new techniques in both filming and viewing. In 2013, DONDA oversaw the concept and design for Mr. West’s minimalist YEEZUS album packaging and groundbreaking global launch, including a guerilla-marketing campaign, the “New Slaves” projections. DONDA is at the center of concept, design and production of Mr. West’s lauded concert experience, the YEEZUS TOUR. DONDA has designed and produced album packaging, staging, music videos and content for Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz, Big Sean, Pusha T and more

Founded in 2008, Roc Nation is a full-service entertainment company, inclusive of artist, songwriter, producer and engineer management; music publishing; touring & merchandising; film & television; new business ventures; and a music label. It is home to a diverse roster comprised of critically acclaimed recording artists, writers and producers including Rihanna, Shakira, Rita Ora, J. Cole, Timbaland, etc. Roc Nation has a partnership with global management company, Three Six Zero. Over the past several years, Roc Nation has been responsible a state-of-the-art recording and distribution deal with the Universal Music Group for JAY Z, Rihanna, and others; Rihanna’s rise as a huge global touring brand; and the launch of the Roc Nation Sports agency, which in its first year has built a roster of such all-star talent as Robinson Cano, Kevin Durant, Victor Cruz and more




Snippet
Won't let 'em take your love away
There's things beyond and love is king
Oh in my mind, come close to me, babe
Spend my whole life in you're company




[Intro: The-Dream + Kanye West]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, woosh
Ballin' money woos, woos, woos
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign
Pop's when you had me on
I could [?] when you had me on

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but
[mumbling]
And if you ever don't than get at me, at me
[mumbling]
We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Bridge: Bon Iver]
What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
(There's no proof)
Those on clouds
Learn to debate YAH
Ain't no love in the playground
(Now I'm speaking truly loud)
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
Ain't no love in the playground
(Waiting by your phone)
That's a long way

[Hook 2: The-Dream]
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder

[Outro: Section 25 sample]
You can see through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them
Throw them away




Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
For the city
Straight up

[Verse 1]
I realize time and feelings, two things you can't reverse
I realize real life the only thing you can't rehearse




[Kanye West]
You just popped in the Lil Jon remix of "The Workout Plan", and
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
And here come the 5 to the 7 and 6
I dropped out of college, I can't count worth shit
When the album dropped I was dissing this
Now everybody know this the shit
Part 2, this the update
First rule: stay away from the cupcakes
The second rule is so underrated
They claim the song was so degradin'
"But shit it's still my favorite
And he ain't talkin' 'bout me though"
Hello, then who I'm talking about, people?
OK, whatever you want to believe though
And I even took my own advice
This gut ain't nothing these hoes’ll like
I said, I look like LL
Took my shirt off, she claimed "I can't tell"
But never say I can't sell
Pat, where we at right now, 3 mil?
Who the best? Who the best now?
OK leave me out of it
Tell me who the rest now?

[Hook]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
‘Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2: Kanye]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said... said... said...

[Verse 2: Twista]
What ‘Sup Lil mama [?]
They call me the twista, now work that Motha'Fucka
But not to hard, baby you can do what you do
Cause i like a fat ass, but [1?]
So, if you could drop it to the floor go and [?]
So, its crush time, Shawty show me you can do so
Gon’ Work it, put down the philly steaks
[?]
I know you love how my lexus ride
But get them with them legs, don’t flex them thighs
You know want it, don’t testify
Try my New Workout Plan called Sex-ercise
That’s real
[Singing]
You don’t wanna go a day without me
She don’t really wanna lay without me
I know you love when i’m workin' it in now, baby we can work it out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Farnsworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day at they fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna...stand...and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

[Outro: Luke]
Work it out, work it out, girl




[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Thanks for having me Tony, you know
She got money from her last two exes
No kids, new Jag, new Lexus
And cook a bad ass breakfast
Just incredible, how the sex is
So I leave her but then I come right back
She be catchin' attitude and I don't like that
Wanna talk that shit, I'mma strike back
Only for the makeup sex and the night cap
They got a bed on the PJ
My thing got beef with your coochie
Got money, still sneak in the movie
Love the adventure and when you do me
I heard last man, soft ass friend like macho man
Lil' tight ass shirt on, let's just call him not your man
I'm just saying

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
F.G., all these, freak bitches wanna sex me
But due to the fact I'm a mac with a mothafuckin' sack
Man a bitch can't stress me
I'm with Alicia, Lauren, and Leslie
Miami rooftop Cabana
Heard they fucked my crew from Atlanta
Now I'm tryna hit it so pardon my manners
I was born with it so pardon this pimpin'
Can't learn nothin' talkin', bitch listen
Need a thick rare thing up in my bed frame
You look like you fit that description
Get up in the GT and get missin'
Push button start, the keyless ignition
Whole damn thing, it cost me 240
'Fore I left the lot I slapped it on Forgi’s, uh
And it don't really matter what you do
Cause I don't know another chick like you
From the front to the back to the side
Ain't another nigga doin' it like I do
Smoked out, I'm toasted
Fucked the bitch and made her lose focus
Off another dose of this dope dick
Tell all your friends, girl, promote this it's Gibbs

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 3: King Chip]
You know a nigga need that one thing
She want a nigga that's stunting
Every time she pitch, I grand slam
Say her man be bunting
Well tonight, we going hunting
She like women like I do
Damn, well tonight we can try two
Damn, where the fuck a nigga find you?
You know a nigga mentally fucked up
Prolly on the bud, walk up in the club, get all the love
All because a nigga fucks with Cud
And even Kanye sees me, he says what's up
Tony I think I found the one
But she can't talk, her man is home
I told her save my name as Shaft Long in her damn phone

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Here’s another day in the life of a champion, knight
Do I do some fight, I’m ashamed but I might
Whether wrong, wheather right
Its a dangerous sight
Are we going in

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I’m feeling like Stevie right now, you know…
I had the strangest feeling lately
The nigga's so fake I'm off it
And every time they flake like frosted
I just make my profit
And get a girl who barely bra fit
Aw shit! He back on his feet like carpet
He was just playing possum
Playing like I wasn't awesome?
Yeah I got some jokes, don't I?
Ha ha ha, laugh it up
And they'll be wack
And we'll be the last ones cracking up
Matter fact, because you nigga wanna doubt me?
Let's see how it feel without me
Taking off on this rocket, Yao Ming

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie

They said be all you can be, nigga
They said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock
I was thinking 'bout murdering
I ain't getting my hands dirty
Let you worry 'bout serving 'em

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Woooh! They said be all you can be, nigga

Woooh! They said the truth set you free

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah
Pour it on you, hallelujah, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said be all you can be

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Pretty girls is my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand to hand
When you got this paper hand in her hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said the truth set you free!

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

[Outro: Pusha T]
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends




[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, yo, I'm tryna catch the beat
Haha, haha, I wanna catch the beat
Haha, haha, I wanna catch the beat
Now, now, now, now, throw your muthafuckin' hands
Get 'em high, ah, say what, say what, come on
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high, let me see them hands up high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high, get 'em high, get 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
Keep 'em high
Ah, now now now now\

[Verse]
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect
R-r-r-r-resurrect, r-r-r-r-resurrect
I'm here to r-r-r-r-resurrect me
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect me
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-resurrect




[Hook: John Legend]
Last night I dreamt of an angel
I almost passed away oh yesterday but I'm blessed today
On top of the world I’m so thankful
It ain't no mystery, it's meant for me to make history

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas thought I couldn't rhyme but I tricked 'em
My pulse quickened, I
Brought myself outta last place, I Michael Vick'd 'em
Niggas thought I let 'em down like Tyson
I got the belt like Lewis
I took these beats, I passed 'em to myself, I'm Kordell Stewart
Back on the corner, back on the block
The Quincy Jones of hip hop, it's my time like Warner
Since I shine like Shyne in '99 with his
A lot of people talkin' real outta like with this
There's a war going on a few bitches wanna start with me
Showing the New World, I'mma Order even more of me
So I can live forever like diamonds
Throw your diamonds up, cause almost dying ain't stop me from rhyming
I hate a deadbeat nigga that rely on his man
See he'll lie on his dick but won't lie on the stand
And go to every single barbershop and lie to the fans
So it's time for Kanye to put the Chi on again
I'm the 2003, Do Or D-I-E
They trying to say the best nigga is Twista, then me
It's all R.O.C., it's all family tree
I got that new G5 he got that new Hum-Vee
Incorporate Young Hov and that's The Blueprint 3
And The Blueprint 2 is 3 mil right now
So cut all that, "I don't like Bonnie & Clyde shit out
Listen

[Bridge: John Legend + Sample]
Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to
Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to
Oooh hooo
I got nowhere to

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Dawg, there's nowhere to hide
All I got is my pride
I almost died
I keep that 2Pac feeling alive
You have no idea how I'm feeling inside
It's the Roc throw your diamonds up in the sky

[Hook: John Legend]




[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines

[Verse 1]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
For I just applied logic keys, keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, Opera, black tux, binocular
Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us
Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence – how am I a legend?
I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven
More hits than a Now 11
That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy as I say my grace!
Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate
For the winter I be fly all summer? Might I say

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 2]
Hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright
We the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word, then I'd much rather die
No no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits
For The Color of Money like a Tom Cruise flick
'Cept I put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh
Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
Dangers approaches, we're like: "Wait, who's this?"
Let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 3]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
Then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ILL
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Outro]
We are really high, really really high, no
Really really high, really high tonight, ha
We are really high, really high tonight
We are really high, really high tonight
Lucky Lefty, kiss the wife goodnight for me, hehe




[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Where all my real ones at?
Hey!

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckas stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
All the bustas stand on dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckas stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Got two bitches bumping clits, that's a cat fight
I'm ridin' with the stick, that's that act right
In here with all my jewels like I'm a Rabbi
Zone 6, East Atlanta, I'm from that side
Uhh, I asked the plug for a kilo
He hit me with a brick like I'm Deebo
Hah, I charged the high for the zero
But we gon' keep that on the D-low
Hah, assault rifle with the peephole
It go A-B-A-B-B-B, Mortal Kombat cheat code
And I'm in here with my chico
Might get you whacked, you standing three close
So

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckers stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
All the bustas stand on dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckers stand on dat side
All the lames stand on that side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
All the haters hating, wait a minute, stand on dat side
I don't need no allies, I don't feel the need to fraternize
Yeezys in the field, Yeezys, Yeezys in the field now
Made it to the NBA, we in the NFL now
All the haters hating, wait a minute, stand on dat side
Moved into a neighborhood where I'm the only black guy
People claim they praying for you, really, they be preying on you
All this shit is weighing on you, don't look back, they gaining on you
"'Ye, look down, they aiming for you, all this shit is draining on you
And the people claim to know you, put 'em on, get famous on you
Then they go and blame it on you, you just good, they can't ignore you"
Don't respect who came before 'em and made they lane so I
Pulled a Lambo out and then I went and got it baptized
Moved into a neighborhood where I'm the only black guy
Neighbors said they think I gave the neighborhood a black eye
They too worried 'bout what I'm doing so I gotta keep my grass high

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
(Dat right, dat right, dat right, dat right, dat right)
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckas stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
I'm so anti, I'm so, I'm so anti
Seen my buddy passout, I'm careful who I stand by
All you do is tell stories, you a campfire
You can barely hold your water, you a damn liar
Look at all the haters who came out to see him
I'm fresh to death, my closet is a mausoleum
They don't like I'm always hopping out of BM's
They don't know how many times I coulda loss my freedom
Went from open mics to rocking coliseums
I just bought your bitch a flight with my per diem
But I would never invite that hoe to my museum
I'm gone by 12 o'clock PM, that just how I treat 'em
So tell them groupie bitches stand on that side
I call these niggas groupies too cause that what niggas act like
Stand on that side, I don't need your advice
Spit my trap like moving weight, I'm a fat guy
Wait, I just wanna see my paper stack like that high
Wait, my girl waist a 28, I like 'em that size
Wait, and them cakes a 38, I like 'em that wide
They ask why I was late, I pointed down and told 'em, "That's why"

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
All the haters stand on dat side
All the suckers stand on dat side
All the lames stand on dat side
Dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side, dat side




[Intro: Irene Reid Sample]
You say, "What is it that you want?"
You've got everything that a woman could ever need in life
I got a closet full of minks, chinchillas
I got a bureau full of diamonds
I could change four times a day if I want to
You're even trying to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread man
Now you know if anybody know, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down and drink some champagne with me and let me rap to you

[Verse 1: Thurzday]
Now I feel it's time to show a side
Of the other, yo, I ain't heard in a while
Kill 'em line for line, I'm feeling good, it's hammertime
Don't cry, baby, it's alright
My new motto is "Fuck it"
Life is a royal flush, I'm all in with no bluffin'
Inhale from the weed smoke
It's a race to the top, homie, Usain Bolt
Little hand on the clock, time's ours
You and I gain hoes by the hour
Thurzday ignore these cowards
Planted  the seed in '99, now we grow like flowers
Buck 50 and I'm holding my weight
Six to seven meals and you still get ate
They say, "Yo, you're too cool." Cool?
I would melt your soul into a costume that I could wear to scare you

[Verse 2: Y-O]
It's like sounds to a blind man, light to the deaf
The sense of touch to you, sign language to a mute
A change in the foam cup, no matter how bring it
It's all gon' make good sense to your sense, uh
Sure you're hearing this verse I deposit to your brain
Co-sign with good credit, they approve my name
Hell's a, uh, hard minted nigga
I loan you tuition at a low interest rate
You gotta reach the finish line, stop Shawty Lo, and
Hello, and runnin' in place, Dey Know
That I'm sort of like a professor of oodles of O's
So recognize all what the syllabus holds
History, finance, chemistry
Geometry, watch how your life shape up
Just stand straight up like a right angle
But keep those squares out your inner circle

[Verse 3: Evidence]
Pounds from London, exchange rate awesome
My rent's half price, I'm going back often
A dollar outta 15, a thousand outta 150
A hundred miles and runnin' on empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To say some wild shit, to feel like the world's against me
We all self-destruct, spontaneous combust
Or sometimes shit outta luck
Another day, another way to line 'em all up
My new slogan, "Sarah Palin, I'm dying to fuck"
I'm at peace, still cry a long time and it's key
Still rhymin' to the sound of the beat, still signin' those T's
And sometimes under those T's
And sometimes ladies under my briefs, I call it underachieve
I'm fuckin' with you under my terms
Please believe I'll be reaching my dreams
I'm fuckin' with Skee




[Intro]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I am the one and only Queen Bee
After me there will be none, but you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as, Lil Kim the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole family stay up

[Verse 1]
This time around I ain't takin no shit, this time around I never get bit
This time around I switched up my flow
Got rid of the pits and put rotts by the do'
This time around it ain't like befo'
This time around I'm gon' crack ya jaw
The feds is watchin me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene my favorite color is green

Love me or hate me Lil Kim come through
My fans across the world I came back for you

[Hook]

Everybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

[Verse 2]
It's the real hip hop mami check the facts
I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya
Come back, to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down

[Hook]
I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

[Verse 3]
This time around either your in or your out
This time around you better watch your mouth
This time around you gon' hang or bang
This time around you better do your thang
Cause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain't no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army y'all can't harm me
If the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve me
Don't get your life tooken I know I got you shooken
This Bed Stuy fly girl came back for Brooklyn




[Intro : Malik Yusef]
In your high honour
All over my skin thats art splattered
And everything happened this part mattered
I tattoed your name on my tongue
Then my heart shattered
But for effort I get an A, girl
So tonight be the VIP guests of JYJ Malik Yusef and Kanye West

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Living life like there's no damn rules
Tonight I'm finna hop up in that hotel pool
Grab your hand, white dress, you gon' hop in too
Get everything that bein' at the top includes
What's your friend's attitude, why she so damn rude? huh?
Tell her smile for a change
If a baller come around, she gone smile for the change
I know they type, I know the life
I know you're living your life for the night, another night
Ask the city what they got for us
That mean it wasn't even poppin' if it not for us
Then isn't isn't this all that I said it'd be
I want the best for you, but want better for me, ugh
I paid the price of fame, icy chain
Stack my money tall, height advantage

[Hook: JYJ]
Let's do it, flashing light
Have the time of your life
Living it up for tonight
Yeah she living it up for tonight
Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
Just run through me
What have you done to me
Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
I'm losing my cool
Playing me for a fool
Ayyyyyy, ayy, ayy girl

I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night
Another night
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night
Another night

We're so high, we touch the sky
You broke my heart, tore me apart
I never lost like this, now its you who'll miss
Like I did give, cause for the night you told me
I'm not the type
Flashing lights
Have the time of your life
Livin' it up for tonight
Yeah she livin' it up for tonight

You came and shut it down
Suddenly you run this town
Wanted to be with you
All I needed was me and you

Now everything is changed
You act differently
You do me wrong
I knew all along

So cold in the rain
Gave my heart in vain
(I'm still in love with you I can't get over you)

You got me goin' insane
Get out of my brain
(I'm still in love with you I can't get over you)




(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man

(Verse 1)
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a Delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man




[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in June

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, one day you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Say aye aye aye
Don't say you will, I pray you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will, unless you will, I pray you will

[Instrumental Break]

[Extended Chorus]
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will
Hey hey hey hey…
Don't say you will
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t say

[Outro/Monologue]
Keep the music on

This is a
This song was written for
A special moment in my life
Someone so special, that I love forever

And you know like, when you break up with somebody
And you have those times where you wanna see ‘em again
And you’re trying to make plans on a Friday night, in New York City
And you clear your whole schedule for this person, even though you’re not together no more

‘Cause there’s nothing better than, someone you know and love
Even if you know you can’t love them no more
You can’t love them no more

Today, take presidents over anybody you dating or going out with or just hooking up with
And she knows who she is
To have someone so special in your life, that you’re inspired by them
I ask myself, as I date
What am I looking for?
The requirement of this position is inspirement
The requirement is inspirement
And I am higher in
But also firing
Also firing, firing

I wanted to express that story better, it didn’t come out as good as I wanted
Wasn’t as poignant as I wanted to make it for my favorite story and for my ode to my loves




[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
Everybody, everybody, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' 'bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later, seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
Throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though, I still speak from my soul
Wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
Came in the game, he made his own lane
All I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, you need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
Father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds, throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
Studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
Uh, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?




[Intro: Kanye West]
I love all your shit talkin', I love all your shit talkin’
You ain't got nothin' better to... do with yourself?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin’ myself
I got new news to tell, act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel and only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' bootch off the nail
Through with mixed messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field, little bit off for the real

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain, I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through better days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn’t make, watch the fakes
Leave ’em buzzin', thought they wasn’t, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
On this road I find (hmm-mmm)
These scars I left behind (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
On this road I find (hmm-mmm)
These scars I left behind (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & JAY-Z]
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & JAY-Z]

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
These niggas want me to go, don’t they know that I'm gone
They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they boring? Don’t they know that I yawn?
Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn
Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off, don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
What the fuck are they Lauryn, they killing me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you do is talk
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them
Somebody talk to them before I go off on them

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & JAY-Z]
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I taught 'em 'bout fish scale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear like it's gon shift for them
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them
But what they admitting is they ain't got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?
Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessing I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal

[Intro: Future]
Hitmaka
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Don

[Intro: Kanye West]
Woman arrested for gettin' naked

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Barrel straight through the peephole
Tell your parents that we home
Propaganda that we own
Crime infested, not contested
Block conventions and street zones
My redemption won't be long (woman)
My religion, fear no man (arrested)
Warrior, Conan, oh man (for gettin')
Horror stories and romance (naked)
Devils that like to slow dance
Kettles burnin' with sin in them
Children don't wanna hold hands
Tourists don't wanna visit and purists die in the maulin'
Fire burnin' through skylines
Follow fortune through guidelines
Bloody Jordans and Popeye's
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high
More divorces and child support lawyers, callin' you, "Dada"
Feds tap on your wifi (skrrt)
Meds makin' you crazy, you dip your head in some agua
Hit the dip while you're drinkin' it
Fuck it, flip on the stop sign
Duck a clip in that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the Honda
Sell a brick to a minor
Makin' wishes for Jannah
Pump your fist up far higher
Reminiscin' bout Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
Welcome to America's future, the great ruler (woman)
Public Enemy's first born, ready to shoot you

[Outro: Kanye West]
I hate when people at me
I'm hurt, so, nigga, don't at me




[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, “It’s Dee-ricious”
Hahahaha, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Kanye West]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls (Uh, uh)
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall (I'm like Bad Santa though)
Even though we ain’t ballin’ (Somebody sit on my lap)
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 2: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York, I’m still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hood

[Verse 4: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus




[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

[Verse 1]
It’s gonna be slow singing, flower bringing
Gat clinging, bat swinging, bullets flyin’, niggas dyin’
Mom’s cryin, faggots really don’t want it
Lead coming, blood gushin from ya arms, legs, head and stomach
I felt the hatred, cause when I turned around like the Matrix
Comin for me, an array of bullets headin dead for me
First the one, and then came the two and three and four
Five, six, seven, shots from a mac 11
Platinum producer killed by haters tonight on Channel 7
He do beats for 2Pac, now coming out the spring from Heaven
Ya know my piece is, hotter than grease is
With no wrong way to eat ya face like a Reese’s
Seem like the second I get some shine
Niggas quit they fuckin’ job so they can hate full time
So, gimme the gat, I hit em wit that
Cock back, blat blat
Let me tell you niggas something familiar
Broke niggas don’t want war, man I’ll kill ya

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

[Verse 2]
Oh oh, I get it, this year, niggas don’t dance
But just rock bulletproof hats and steel pants
Now everybody got a gun in they hand, yeah bitch nigga run to ya man
Street sweeper aerials fuck where they land
Niggas close they eyes and don’t aim like My bitch when she pop champagne
Bottles, I tell you bout them damn models
They can’t cook for a lick, but they’ll lick a dick and swallow
Look I been living my life, Bullshittin’ when I write songs
Especially talkin’ bout havin’ ice on and I could barely keep my lights on
Niggas played me like Ty-Son, trying to take my light songs
Cuse they know I’d knock niggas the fuck out the box
Full Glocks, the fuck out the box, cocked
Who the fuck tryin to box right now?
I feel like, my whole city on my back
I feel like, next year, my whole city on the map

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way

[Verse 3]
I’m from, Chi town, where the raps the realest
The tracks gorilla, we got the millas and we’ll be at ya scrilla
Close your doors, lock your windows
We be at them execs for them back end checks
Now, We on the court, and we got next up
Now, This summer we got benz, we got Lex truck
It’s kinda like trading places huh? I never plug
But I’m guilty by association, so gangstas show me love
For that track I did, yeah I know, the rest the album wack as shit
Ooooh, its Kanye to the with that platinum shit, ya punk bitch

[Hook]
Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way




[Chorus: Kanye West]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Oh
Man, this one for my old girl that stayed down
Even though I've been gone, she hold me down like I stay 'round (Right)
Been had her a new man but she still gon' come lay down (Oh God)
And bust it all night like a motherfucking Greyhound
And I know that you spend night after night
Sippin' liquor on liquor
Rolling with women on women
What's that? Bump bad bitches
But girl, you finer than your fine friends (Ooh)
Every time I bump into ya, I'm like, "Where the fuck the time went?"
I skrt skrt, then you climb in
And we catch up, yessir (Yeah)
I feel that dresser (Oh God)
And we talk about everything
Except who we dating, that ain't nece-
Necessary (Woah), fuck the life, she my secretary (Wow)
Ass and face is hereditary
Her mama, shit, legendary

[Chorus: Kanye West & Big Sean]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone
Oh God, ooh

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You got that hair long, I like that shit (Woah)
Titties hanging out, I like that shit (Woah)
Drama, I don't invite that shit
Text back, we really don't write that shit
Girl, I know you got options
You used to flying to islands (Go)
Dining Italian, what probably shopping with stylists
Stylists should just dress you naked
Shit, that's the best outfit (God)
Red light special but red light don't mean stopping
While we save sexy, lay texy
Rub or stretch me, caress me
Oh, good weed, no stress eat
I swear them times is the bestie
Girl, hell yeah
I feel like everybody got somebody like that
But no matter who you with, you still one night that
And no matter where you at, you just go right back
Right-right-right-right back

[Chorus: Kanye West with Big Sean]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man it's crazy when you love someone you hate
And hate someone you love
But then just love someone you love
And you'll do anything for
And you don't even know, relationship
And all that hating shit, and all that complicated shit
And everything is just great 'cause you know girls get crazy
Crazy what? Like Jamaican or what?
Crazy like fucking Satan or what?
Crazy like the asylum, asylum, Salem
I don't know what I'm saying
I don't-I don't know what I'm saying
I don't-I don't know what I'm saying, man




[Verse: Kanye West]
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord




I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah I'm 'bout Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would drive me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been

Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want




[Intro]
Blood, one time, check

[Hook]
I said I Blood so hard red cross can't find me
First niggas gotta find me
Who started this gangtsa shit? Motherfucka please remind me 

[Verse 1]
Blood so hard everything red
Niggas Blood more than me this shit weird
Light the tree come on T.V
Niggas throwing up signs like Paul pierce
Blood so hard I forever bleed
Join a gang out here you can never leave
When the album drop, I'm the new PAC
My bitch wanted me to get a nose ring
Blood so hard nigga nose bleed
Why you motherfuckas sittin in the nosebleed?
I'm on my twitter dm'in hoes
Why you motherfuckas bein so nosy?
How could you fall for that fakeout believing that media takeout
Talkin bout how I ate the box bitch you can't even get takeout
One beef nigga meet me at the steakhouse
Come alone nigga this ain't no stakeout
No cops in here just Glocks in here
This shit will blow your face out
Niggas be all up on myspace put the hammer on your Facebook
I come around upside down frown show a nigga how that k look
Come around lay it down nigga jay showed you
And jay told you
And jay showed you

[Hook]
LA Leakers, said I blood so hard red cross can't find me
First niggas gotta find me

Blood so hard red cross can't find me
First niggas gotta find me
Who started this gangsta shit motherfucka please remind me




Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?
Bring it on, pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week

And I'm ballin', blow the whistle

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Let 'em all in
Let them fall in it
Let them play with all the dollars
Let them bathe in it
House so large, put a maze in it
I'm the type that take your chick out for lunch
In the middle of the White House lawn
Then switch up, start filming porn
Might tell the First Lady she can join
Do what I want when I want
Nigga you can keep them two pennies
I got a tub so big you can come and take swimmin' lessons in it
Now I'm peelin' off in a spaceship, with the ceiling
She just want to show her titties off
Carpet roll out, wanna hop off
Bout to hit the club like golf balls
Paparazzi tryna catch a nigga off guard
Nigga got me off the chain like guard dogs
Come on, dog
I'm too high, hot air balloon
All star, I'm on another planet
I just joined the fortune five hundred
Now I'm in the boardroom in pajamas

[Hook: Kanye West + Juicy J]
And I'm ballin', I'm, I'm, and I'm ballin', I
And I'm ballin', and I'm ballin'

And I'm ballin', and one
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
And I'm ballin'
When you're boss you don't take shit, you don't call in
So fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
Folks ain't never gonna get it, I've been holding out long enough
Scratch that, now I'm on to somethin'
Fuck that, I ain't letting up
Cats gonna copy this shit
They gonna wanna hold my awards
Poor lil' Juicy J, this year I'm declaring war
Fuck they upset with me for?
Shut up J and be a decoy
Who the fuck they thinkin' we are?
M-Town ride smokin' blunts
We up, keep up, my chips, cheese puffs
That's real dope
See us Gd up, money talks, speak up
Sleep, what for?
I get some rest when I croak
I want a new island to dock my new boat
I went to the action and bought me a chopper
Now I need a new helipad for my home

[Hook: Kanye West + Juicy J]
And I'm ballin', I'm, I'm, and I'm ballin', I
And I'm ballin', and I'm ballin'

[Chorus]
Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

[Verse]
Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

[Outro]
Chick-fil-A




As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes
Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi
If I go too fast down this road I end up like Left Eye
I’m wondering would it be better if I left life
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I’m gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone, looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her what she crying for
I’m so fresh I’m wondering "why didn’t I design clothes?"
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they gon' make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean? No
Man please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils
(ahem) Shut up bitch swallow
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It’s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life dog it’s me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit
And I don’t mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's selfless
I’m feeling like a crab in a bucket
That’s just tryna get it crackin'
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish

And it’s a dream come true that you signed me
Big Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee
People asking me how it happened, man I tell 'em
I Rolex-ed the situation and just had perfect timing
And you already know where to find me
Bitch I'm connected to the D like Siamese
So if you see me out of town getting money
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly
So say what up if you see us
And the D is burn rubber and the Sean man lead us
Like being undefeated, feeling undefeated
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus
Glad to do any interview or dope feature
Come holla at a nigga as I’m trying on sneakers
Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can’t be it
You are just a hundred-and-one percent bitch
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
And I don’t want fans, I want believers
Race to success so I'mma keep pedalin'
Cuz my mama man she deserve everything
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her
Then best believe she gon' get a wedding ring
But I don’t know if I believe in love to be honest
Cuz every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up
And that’s why girls wanna leave us
Tell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us
Won’t stop till we end up on that show Cheaters
But I bet you couldn’t spot me if a nigga wore cheetah
And I be in the strip-club Teasers
Giving all the girls what’s needed
Honest dog had so many problems dog
I could hand 'em out and be labeled a fuckin' teacher
So respect my hand gesture
I dare any nigga try and come test us
You a mothafuckin' act dog, a A.C.T. that’s why niggas try and test ya
A-Dub how the hell we gon' make a mil
Pay the bills man, I ain’t tryna waste a deal
If you could make a deal believe you could break a deal
And if you can’t keep your promises then don’t say you will
Nigga don't say you will




[Intro: Jaheim]
Believe me when I tell ya
You don't want the drama

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
A yo, for years I been buyin' my coke from the same cat
Dominican nigga who look black (that's right)
This summer I heard that (ha!)
I see me always swerve wit a (give it up!) where the bird at (yeah)
Apocalyptic, I pop biscuits (apocalypse), my bitch is topless
Not too excited I skeet skeet my own boxes
Drama King got the drama goods (bluh, bluh, bluh!)
Same place as the Domin' Osama Hood
Shoot up the thug and still puttin' the dame on it
The pimps had to give me a cup wit my name on it
I was "Gordito"
I'm still Gordo or "Gito"
Still know how to get the raw dough for cheap-o (cheap)
I'm lastin' all palm wit the connect of a "perico" (parakeet)
N.O.R.E. got no manners (no manners!)
I take a picture of ya "culo" wit the phone cameras
Go into ya own banners (ha!), they say my ballin' so hot like lone candles
And port or part of Santiago wit my own hammers (oh!)

[Hook: Jaheim, Left Gunz]

[Left Gunz] Believe me when I say (oh!)
[Jaheim] You don't want no drama
[Left Gunz] It's ghetto die hood, thugged out all day (what?!)
[Jaheim] You don't want no problems (oh ohh!)
[Left Gunz] Shit is real killer, you could ask KaySlay
[Jaheim] Believe me when I tell ya!
[Left Gunz] We drama kings nigga we don't play
[Jaheim] You don't want the drama

[Verse 2: Nature]
Nature, alright, the year 2000 and 4 the War Report (port)
Niggas make it out the hood, it's a small reward (ward)
We all fucked up and mauled cause that's all we saw (alright)
Tryin' to rob from the the rich and let the poor get poor (poor)
Or rob the poor cause niggas be the hungriest (my niggas)
I'm on the Internet - catch me on your Buddy List (I'll be in trouble, ha!)
Catch me where the money is, megas and millions (megas)
And the barrel got the kick of 11 guerillas (shout!)
Seen niggas get hit and lose a whole lot of blood (what?)
When a nigga legit, a nigga knowin' how to stunt (stunt)
Uptown, Downtown, go wherever he at (wherever he at)
Nigga make it implication, shit better be fat (shit better)
Nigga small talk, it's all talk - let it be that (let it be that)
I get pussy from my friends (pussy!) give my enemies clap (ha ha!)
You don't want me on ya block (you don't want me) niggas better be strapped
So relax nigga

[Hook: Jaheim, Left Gunz]

[Verse 3: Left Gunz]
My name ring from the Clippers to the Nets (yeah)
You could look and see I'm Dirty Jerz down to the zippers on my sweats (oh)
Far from the type of cat that pay a bitch's rent
I got a +Fox+ like +Vivica+ and never gave her +50 Cent+ (ha ha!)
And I bet you ain't ready for war yet (uh)
My niggas got stripes, who walk around like the Barbershop Quartet? (ooh!)
It's no way to harm this nigga
I don't need no bitch to pump eye until my arms get bigger
Still a problem in this the rap game, problem in the street
Yo Slay, they havin' problems, we can solve em wit the heat
I show em what the drama is
That's when ya whole shit splattered all across the front porch in momma crib
And wit a couple hot slugs get behind ya ribs (ooh!)
You really mean it when ya screamin' , "I'm just tryin' to live!"
The game is over now
Y'all niggas slept long enough, time to come up out that coma now, uh

[Hook: Jaheim, Left Gunz]

[Verse 4: Jaheim]
Yo, straight off the bat
You don't want the drama nigga Left Gunz gon' clap
When I'm comin' try to run and catch one in ya back
Ooh! You don't really want the problems
Got a whole lot of family out in Spanish Harlem
Pop goes the weasel, out comes the Mack
And nothin' to gain but pimpin' the game




[Verse 1]
It's not Jay-Z and Beyoncé
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope and Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden Calf

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, the secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Verse 2]
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix
Pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the Google of United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 2]
You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
C'mon, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Breakdown]
It's like
It's like
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Outro]
Everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati




[Chorus]
Thug life, all on me
They said it's graphic
I said, "Thug life, all on me"

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Body electric
Why so much static?
Hitting in the ghetto, let's keep it frank
What's going on in your attic?
And I'm your pusher
But somehow your attic (Yo)
Do you have a head to Philippe
To get this Patek?
Body electric
Why so much static
Thug life, all on me
They said it's graphic
I said, "Thug life, all on me"
This shit is graphic
Thug life, all on me
They said it's graphic, graphic
Body electric
Why so much static
Body electric
Why so much static
Thug life, all on me
They said it's graphic
I said, "Thug life, all on me"
I stretch my hands to thee, I'm Mr. Fantastic
In the whip, shift the stick, it's automatic
(Thug life, all on me)
She said, "Is that a Glock
And how you shoot it if it's plastic?"
(Thug life, all on me)
Throw my heart and swipe my plastic
You make me speak and wheeze and I'm not asthmatic
And I'm alive with the supreme, it's magmatic
And I never sleep, I'm restless
And I'm restless in my rest so I can dream
Dream a dream, galactic

[Outro]
(My way, my way, my way)
And fly
Ooh, ooh
(My way, my way, my way)
And fly
Ooh, ooh
Spread my way

06. Part 6: Aerodynamic (Outro)




I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

Gotta admit to this little addiction
To the ladies and they just can't fix him
Conversation and the drinks start mixin'
And I'm a champ like the Detroit Pistons

I tried to contain myself
But I can't restrain myself
I can only blame myself
Maybe I need to get some help

Now what can I do?
It's so hard to choose
This one's for you
Yeah all of you

I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

My starting five how do I pick them?
I came up with this rating system
I think about how it feels when I kiss them
And when I'm gone do I truly miss them?
Well baby, you made the team
Now go cook my favorite things
Greens and some chicken wings
Tastes so good that you make me wanna sing

So what can I do?
It's so hard to choose
This one's for you
Yeah all of you

I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

I'm calling
Out to
All my
Y'all my ladies, and I can't
Let you, be with, no one, but me, baby

Uhh, can the headphones go louder?
Kanye West!
Yup, Swag King Cole, yup
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
Flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu

Did you ever think of a dream too big to measure?
Follow your pleasure, one day you'll face
The law of attraction, be careful what you ask for
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Put a stack on it, huh, put a MAC on it, huh

And I black on ‘em, huh, and we back on ‘em, huh
On a map on ‘em, huh, got a stack on ‘em, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
The world is on for four seasons, there's somethin' for a reason
They just talk, don’t read it, I lead on some, nah, don’t lead it
More or so, what you leave with? I got somethin' for you to leave with
What they tell 'em, don't believe it
Tell me what you believe in, tell me what you believe in
Grand theft auto, grand theft auto, we in a game, we in a game
Grand theft auto, grand theft auto, we all the same, we all the same
Money ain't real, time ain't real, money ain't real, time ain't real
Money ain't real, time ain't real, guess to what, you never get killed

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Did you ever think of a dream too big to measure?

Yo, yo, yo, the way I been treated in this industry? Not nicely
Little faggot motherfucker like {*Mike Lighty*}
Tried to get someone to pop my chain
Gettin' robbed dog, is not my game
My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang
Reversed the situation, popped his chain
Be happy we ain't pop his brain
Ayo, I treat that show money, Mike..
Like it's coke money, aight?
So you better have it, consequence could be a casket
I'm beyond forensic, a menace with a Matic
I'ma leave 'em in the streets just splattered
Beat and battered, fuck cops, police don't matter
Bring 'em to me

[Chorus]
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)

[Break: Jim Jones over Chorus]
Triple noooooo, come on, B's up, Dipset, uh

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Yo, ayo I pop to my name
With not a dollar, not a cent, not a rock to my name
Yo I'ma keep it funky dog, I'll hop my chain
For a block of cocaine, now it's back to my block with cocaine
You know, re-in up, and fillin' up them pots with cocaine
Then you chop it up, and bottle up and top the cocaine
Got watch for the cops and they chains
For them Diplomatic affairs, automatic'll flare
I whips everything from automatics to gears
Yeah, you know sticks I clutch 'em
Shots with 6 I bust 'em, cop kicks to scuff 'em
Fuck 'em, hop out the 6 and crush 'em
Hop in the 6 and dust 'em, BOOM!

[Chorus]
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Yo.. ayo, these niggas talkin' shit?
They about to get hit with fuckin' clips
You better let 'em know
I got girls that'll buy my a quarter
Supply me with water, beef come? Drive me to borders
Kamikazes with they hommies, body your daughter
Turn your whole crew into Dodgers like Tommy Lasorda

[Verse 4: Jim Jones]
Yeah, come on
So you faggots have that money in order
Jim'll come through with wolves and let the hungry extort ya
Now how is that for the drama suspense?
Any beef, our piranhas get sent
Kidnap your momma for rent
Hot shots from the Beretta'll a fly
I'm breakin' bread with my guys, we want it dead or alive
Dipset, BOOM!

[Chorus]
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)
Ah-oh no, bring 'em dead or alive (WHOA!)




[Intro]
Yap, yap, yap
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, fuck you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Nigga behave

[Verse]
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Niggas in, ayy, niggas been bumpin' the messes
Niggas got so many questions
Fuck you and fuck you, your bestests
Talkin' some shit on my methods
I piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade, in the third grade
This one right here for the kids at the grade
In the third grave
How come you want it? Can't fuck with the bitch
This one ain't fair, this one for family
This one the damn, this one I thank
That's when thought it was safe and it wasn't
Pointer me, Allah, some on your water
I'm callin' your mada, call on the collar




[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Uh, what
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
The motherfucking Skateboard P
Knowing that you're Milo, playing games like cee-lo
In a tight situation like speedos
You can have it your way like Carlito
My niggas would be happy to give y'all torpedoes
And have your car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot-ass niggas that like to front
I’m on some BBC Bape shit, I'm on some cake shit
In the kitchen with the heat, making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can’t take it
My flow interrupts your homeostasis
I Rolls-Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street shit, it sound like sweet shit
Straight licorice, you niggas sound ticklish
80K large for the Hermès dream
Purple croc in all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine, Dion
Me and my niggas like Freon
Your bitch is on my pecan, she got an ass you can eat on
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton
I hit it 'til I could seat on, tryna get her freak on
Ask me to R. Kelly ya and get peed on
I said, "That ain't me, ma'am"
That eight behind me still got the burner
Yes, the enzo is still black like Sojourner
Truth, I might have just loosened a tooth
Spitting what I did in the booth, I’m out, poof

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Carrera, raised in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle era
Water-bearer tell the truth, I dare ya
Ya lie, so eat this whole bottle of these jalapeño peppers
For terror made in America, too live
Fuck the property or give me my props properly
High off life, this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rap-ology
My policy’s not to be dishonestly, deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God where my city at
I’m like steak and fries but never died
They wanna Ghostface, wanna be me
But they will post-haste follow me into the afterlife
That means you going right after I’ve
But I’m the hero, sort of like Jack Sparrow
So some way, somehow, I have survived
Ha, ha, surprised?
Who is he that we see coming over the tides?
In a speed boat, boatload of pride
Fall of Rome, dress-shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rapping and avant garde fashion collides
OMG, it's the 'C' from the CRS
LOL-ing at you haters, tell your BFFs like

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yes, Mr. West, turn that new Child Rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus? We do it Tyrannosaurus
Tyrone, it’s been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone?
We’ll take the plane, rub his nose in cocaine
There’s hoes in magazines you layin' saying you're lame
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
Make ‘em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue, his business manager’s Jewish
And if I get sued, my lawyers Jews
Some girls do grab the cojones
Say, "You got enough diamonds to at least Sierra loan us"
Brand new Ferraris, I gotta make the donuts
CRS is like a hip-hop Christmas bonus
Niggas is hating on the internet, I couldn’t tell
I was too busy rapping, G.O.O.D. as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail
To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinci, getting Benjies
Get half-off of Fendi, half of that’s to Cindy's
Hopped out the spaceship, put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York but Chi-Town’s the city
Get my groupie hoochies Gucci, Monica Belluccis
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies?
I’m so ultra, I’m even over Oprah
But let me check your account, haha, no sir




[Hook]
I make a lot of new different money
Trap overnight like it's fifty summie
Finesse up the plug while gettin', I'm gettin' blunted

Sniff the coco right up cause your bitch got problems
Wildin' boy, wildin' boy, wildin' boy
Life of Desiigner be stylin' boy
You gettin' hit up, I get annoyed
Mike on the wheel and I drive the toy
You get robbed or get jigg or you got extort

[Bridge]
Tell 'em talk shit, tell 'em talk shit, I'ma keep throwin'
That's your bitch, that's your bitch, that be deep throatin'
We be swipin' cards, we be gettin' money, there's weed blowin'

[Intro]
W-W-W- Well Done
Let’s try some different shit

[Verse 1]
Ahhh
I’m so flashy, you so ratchet
Twelve jewels fashion with a pedal to Matchin'
New Maybach, that’s a hit nigga
Could’ve been the 3rd member, the clipse nigga
Listen niggas, I go grizzly that’s Memphis nigga
Ross rap that 24, ain’t gotta convince niggas
Early pimpin, throw like Blake Griffin
Lips zip it
Niggas gossip like it’s tradition
These bitches can’t drive my car
The melt engine, hell’s risen
Ride Diablo to a baptism, he Christian
Fear nothing but God, kill all except women and children
I don’t testify not in my interest
Persistence, diligence, the skill I bring can feed the hunger mission
Got the whole world, fill em on my brand but they won’t mention it
You afraid of my accomplishments
You a bitch, straight up got a taser for my bitch with a laser
And she just wishin' for a genie in the bottle
This is not a novel, we no feel for sorrow and it shine tomorrow
Super dollars like a super lotto, shootin' at yo collar
Now you sippin' soup to swallow
Go throwin' in the towel
Our time is now but we devour everything we offer
Then pop it up but drink and blow a sake
Mr. kick shit Myiagi
Wax on, wax off
Ferrari, she gon' lick the lolly
I am not the baby boy terazi, slick lody
Laughin at yo clown pose, you bust into you
I got arsenal, time to give to be impossible
Options to embarrass you, I just choose what God would do
Can’t waste my time on you
Fuckers can’t rhyme no more
Bout crime no more
Made so much money at home, didn’t even tour
My fans waitin', savin' up for greatness, I appreciate it
Let’s get back to basics




[Intro: Adele Givens]
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka!"

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (Love it, love it)
(I'ma fuck a bitch, tell her cousin)
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (Dork)
(McLovin; ooh, ooh, ooh)
I just pulled up in a Ghost (Ghost)
Fucked that bitch up out in London (Up out in)
Then I fucked up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (Uh-uh, woo)
And my niggas gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant (Ignant, yeah)
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (Fell!)
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? (Where we at?)
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank (Purpp!)
Ooh, fuck, she take lines (Lines)

[Chorus: Lil Pump & Kanye West]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it, scoop!)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

[Interlude: Kanye West]
You're such a fuckin' ho
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a fuckin' h—

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (Whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch (Bitch, bitch, bitch)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

[Outro: Adele Givens]

They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:

You're the only power (power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (power)

Ohh, ohh, ohh, father...
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe

If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Verse: Kanye West & Kelly Price]
Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you some'n
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...
I wanna wake up with you in my...

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi, Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir & Kelly Price]
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe

Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands




[Intro: JAY-Z]
Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We livin' in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches (You know what time it is), watch us (You see us)
They can't stop us, the prophets, biatches!

[Chorus: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power (Yeah)
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours (Yeah)
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
No one man should have all that power

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes, you gon' stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Man, you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, "Is this what this all comes to?"
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you?
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They tryna Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this!

[Chorus: Kanye West, John Legend & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power
Yea-ey-yea-ey-yeah-ey!
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
No one man should have all that power

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Now when I walk in, everybody do the "Power" clap
Clap, clap, clap
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap
Clap, clap, clap
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap
Clap, clap, clap
My socket was out the plug, now it’s time to get the power back
Clap, clap

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I seen people abuse power, use power
Misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it’s a new hour
Now we all ain't gonna be American Idols
But you can 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral
Hanh! Take the power in your own hands
I’m a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don’t stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I’m on my Van Gogh, I don’t hear shit

[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours (Ey-yeah!)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (The power)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'ma drop 'em in Islam
They say "As-salamu alaykum", say "Wa alaikum as-salaam"
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we gon' stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, 'cause you know he drop bombs

[Break: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime!
Aiyyo Yeezy, man, stop playing with these people, man
They want see you act all crazy in this motherfucker, man
Take that jacket off and go crazy on them niggas, man
You know what I’m talking about? (I got the power!)

[Verse 5: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
What do it mean to be the boss? (Oh!)
It mean second place is the first one who lost (Oh!)
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross (Oh!)
Truth or fiction, it’s a hell of a cost
Do the dishes! (Bounce!)
I’m about to hit that Jeff Gordon (Ayy!)
Michael Jordan, the only one more important (Ayy!)
But I be feeling like Jordan when I’m recording (C-c-c)
'Cause every time I record, I dunk and slap the boards
I don’t know what these rappers gonna do afterwards (Oh!)
Prol'ly spaz like I might do at the awards (Right!)
Huh, I got the whole crowd going crazy (Ayy!)
Homie, I should be rewarded (Woo!)
Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh? (Woo!)
Eating Wheaties, drinkin' Fiji, being greedy, huh (C-c-c)
Don’t even think you can allude to the rumors (C'mon!)
I’m immune to the boos, I’ma prove to you losers (Huh?)
It’s all in timing, nigga (Get 'em!)
See, I dreamed my whole life
That I could rhyme with Jigga (Get 'em!)
Now Jay my big brother and Bey my lil' sister (Get 'em!)
And excuse me, but, you can’t see my lil' sister (Hands in the air!)
Number one sound across the board, hey (Oh!)
Number one now and forevermore, hey (Oh!)
Number one rule is, "Niggas, don’t hate"
Maybe I’ll drop the album... nah, y’all gotta wait (Oh!)
And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I’m the one that got away (Woo!)
I think about 'em Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway (Ayy!)
And keep my bulletproof-hater coat on
Chill, Ye, Ye, chill! Chill, chill, chill!
Looking at some photos that I’m looking crazy dope on (Yah!)
Hand up, talking shit, yeah, I get my Pope on
And go home with something to poke on (Woo!)
That’s what Dre said, but this what 'Ye said (Right!)
How 'Ye doing? Who 'Ye screwin'? (Huh?)
That’s for my dick to know, before you get to know him
She ain’t give you ass, that pussy fictional
I gotta give her the eviction no-
-tice, "Get yo’ ass out, bitch, vamonos" (Oh!)
Five seconds to the song and we getting close (Hah?)
I got the power, motherfucker, if you didn’t know

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, man
Chill, 'Ye, chill, chill, chill
Shit's burned up already
It's over




[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Bought a big house and a whole lot of rangers
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
And some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions for some high-paid painters
Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless
And a new relationship with a banker
Two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered
To watch my possessions and look out for strangers
And a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor
Young supermodel that shall remain nameless
Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes
All the money in the world don't make it painless (No)

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
(But they love it and they love it)
The more you try to erase me
(And they love it and they love it)
The more that I appear, oh
(and they love it and they love it)
The more, the more you try the eraser
The more that you appear

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(Plain Pat what up?)
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new beautiful faces
At home supermodel, Myspaces
Long for their shot on the TV screens
American Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week they want to see ID
Now they got you in VIP, huh?
How many people almost famous?
You almost remember what they name is
Like "Hey, didn't you play in..?
No, it couldn't be, quit playin'"
And try to keep that balance after MTV
That's a Real World Challenge
Back on that train
Never to be heard from again

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
(But they love it and they love it)
The more you try to erase me
(And they love it and they love it)
The more that I appear, oh
(and they love it and they love it)
The more, the more you try the eraser
The more that you appear

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
G.R.I.P P.I.M.P
I, any spelling bitch come on that's me
I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
Like an eye drop of turpentine
You can listen to the serpent, fine
But the earth got gas, once it burps it's fine
Someone around me they talk about degrees
Not GHG, how to cook a quarter key
Talking all nasal, he ain't over that cold
No glove, scrub, man he just over that stove
Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time
Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline
Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish
Egg shell off white like a DuPont finish
Young, dumb, high strung, who could handle us
I wonder how God's gon' paint todays canvasses
'Cause who knew that day that man would just
Go to VA with a Tec and spray campuses?
What a way to see the cover of Time
I know that nigga wish he was standing in line
To see it, as if he didn't do it

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
(But they love it and they love it)
The more you try to erase me
(And they love it and they love it)
The more that I appear, oh
(and they love it and they love it)
The more, the more you try the eraser
The more that you appear




[Chorus: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said "It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me"
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
But if you really cared for her
Then you woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, "You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new"
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town

[Hook: John Legend]
Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home




[Intro: Keri Hilson talking]
Not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say
"Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again (Whoa, whoa)
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call (Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Outro: Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah

[Intro]
"This is the operator with a collect call from: 'Emory Jones'
To accept the charges, press 1 now"

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Emory, whattup?
Told you I ain't too good with writing letters and all
Shit, I don't even write rhymes
But what I will do
I'mma send you this open scribe through the airwaves
Vibe with me...
Yeah, nigga, I bet we was kids and had dreams of being here
I said "we" 'cause I'm here, you here!
Yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved, family
Cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go
We in South Beach and the Hamptons, too, baby!

[Chorus: John Legend]
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You know why they call the projects a project
Because it's a project!
An experiment, we're in it, only as objects
And the object for us to explore our prospects
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!
As kids we would daydream, sitting on our steps
Pointing at cars like yeah that's our sex
Hustlers profits made our eyes stretch
So on some Dr. Spock shit, we started our trek
Some of us made it, most of us digressed
In the name of those who ain't made it, my progress
We show success, please live through me
See, I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive
(This is a collect call) So every time I press 5
All he wanna hear is his boy talk fly
Up in the fed, and still holdin' his head
So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread
Now let's ride

[Chorus: John Legend]
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?

[Jay-Z: over Chorus]
I'm crushing all award shows
MTV, BET, the Grammys, crushed linen, Purple Label
All that fly shit we talked about
Giving them Sinatra pinky rings with the blue diamonds and everything
Hehehe, that's what we talked about right?
Uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
International Hov, I told you so
40/40s out in Tokyo
Singapore, all this from singing songs
Coming up though we thought slinging raw
Was the end-all-be-all of being rich, didn't we?
Little did I know my mo' potent delivery
Would deliver me, kingpin of the ink pen
Monster of the double entendre, Coke is still my sponsor
Heh, the Cola, yeah
Hova still getting it in with soda
Diet, no sir, I ain't lose no weight
Started from the crates now I'm sitting on a whole case
Since they got you sitting on that old case
Our dreams is on hold like TiVo
So I can't wait till you get your date
I got some temp plates outside of the gate
We gon' ride

[Chorus: John Legend]
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?

[Jay-Z: over Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Geah
Don't even worry about it though, you ain't missed nuttin
It only gets better, they got the Maybach Coupe now
Look like the Batmobile, the Phantom the top just comes off that joint
It only gets better
They caught your body they can't trap your mind
Keep your spirit alive read your books
Matter of fact, let me take you somewhere
Vibe with me, c'mon

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now me and my lil' mama, Quita and Ty-Ty
Juan and Dez out in Saint-Tropez

You know that Mary J., give you no more drama
Lost a couple friends this whole shit got weird
But when you get home you know your spot's reserved, ya heard?
I put my niggas on, my niggas put they niggas on
Now we all somewhere foreign, chillin', sippin' somethin'

Big Homie! Hehe, Emory, what's up?

[Chorus: John Legend]
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?

[Outro: Jay-Z]

[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Damn, damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that
It wasn't even, even that big, man
You know, nah, it's ight though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
And let me get those bags from Paris, and the puppies is staying, yo!

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cuz I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird, you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'nigga, you know me'
Stop fronting for them niggas outside like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'mma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a nigga went to war, vest banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Fuckin' with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
Shorty what is you thinking bout
Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yea
That's the bosses chick, on the side
I might of had, one or two
Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, try'nna get revenge
That shit, you just don't do

[Hook to fade]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, you see, this for the knucklehead
Females out there that wanna be
Acting like they getting they little revenge off
Taking it further than what it really is
You know what I mean, playing yourself...
Nahwhatimean... this is Don status, girl
You will have to hold that now...
Word up, and when I see money
I'mma hang him upside down, it's on
And not because of you neither, you know
You don't even need that... it's real
Yeah... got my swagger back and all that
Theodore for life, yo, yeah
Get that tattoo off ya back and all that
Take that off, you ain't Theodore no more
Youknowhatimean?




[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(AH!) What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
1 and, you brought 2 friends, ok, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I'm up out M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...
Yup! Fuck you, pay me!
I drown my pain in Porsches, I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes, see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest or I could just call this a night
On dark nights, it's like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs, motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait, I ain't done; I'ma freestyle this, Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo?
'Cause I'ma go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gon' say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval? I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York, turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard; that's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I dont care what what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of me, she gon go down
Maybe I would've slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be numba one
I guess its gon be what its gon be
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Big blue, hot and sandy shoe
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
Play with me, see what the swammy do
My canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your family dues
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble goose
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots getting fucking loot
My top down, I’m flashing on em
I’m passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
The ratchets on ‘em, pay my dues, now it’s back to ballin'
Your raps are boring dead men, I dip the casket for em
I’m back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don’t call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin’
Stunt stormin, got these bitches soaked
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’mma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye,” I said “Yes, bitch”
"Damn I’m only asking you a question"
I met this MILF at the All-Star getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie I’m pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free,” I said, "wowzers"

[Ryan Leslie]
Let's get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait, where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, 10 to 8, Interstate 95
Passenger, baddest bitch in the states
Half Spanish, half Trinidad, complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit

[Verse 1]
I miss the old Fortnite, the uncontrolled Fortnite, the paper-gold Fortnite, the unsold Fortnite, I hate the new Fortnite, the pro noob Fortnite, the always 'new' Fortnite, the Twitter news Fortnite, I miss the dope Fortnite, the rising slope Fortnite, I gotta say, at that time I liked to play Fortnite, see I first started Fortnite, I used to slay Fortnite, and now I shoot and shoot around and It's just 8's Fortnite, I used to love Fortnite, I used to love Fortnite, I even had the Skull trooper, thought I was Fortnite, what If Wiik made a song about Fortnite, called 'I miss the old Fortnite' old school Fortnite, and what I was Fortnite

[Outro]
We still love Fortnite, and I love you like Fortnite loves Fortnite




[Chorus: Kanye West]
Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?" (we do)
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box (fuse box)
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here

[Chorus: Pusha-T]
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Poop, scoop!
Whoop! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
"You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
Got a surrogate, his kid get two dads"
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Hook: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

[Outro: Grandma & Big Sean]
Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you
It's all good, I love you grandma
Bye




[Verse 1]
You don't want to see these murder guys
Princess cuts hurt your eyes
Got the chicks that work them thighs
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes
Leave your eyes closed
Bricks in my trunk while I ride slow
Smoke your fire dro
No repercussions
He was disgusting
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If them people come rushing
Can't say I froze
Won't open the doors
By the time they caught up
I done disposed of my outer clothes
Car in the garage
I say good god
My day was hard
Call two freaks up for the ménage à trois
Parlaying was hard
Sade was suave
When we was screwing
Sheets was ruined
If beef is brewing
I'm a put slugs deep into him
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards for hatin'
Master my patience
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin'
Passion for Satan
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holding shit down with they tough ass
We alias
They wishing they be us
Can't three-eighty us
Cause we will wreck everything within a ten block radius
When you see me better speak with love
Or leak some blood
I got connections with all type of BM, chiefs and govs
Deeply plugged who got to retire from crime
About to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it

[Hook]
Hit 'em in the body and the dome
Left the after party with the chrome
Come up with a milly
And as soon as everybody know that I'm gone
Gotta keep it Gangsta'
Cause I'm a hustla'
Do it like a balla'
Cause I'm a mobsta'

[Verse 2]
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection to cop me a brick
And he sent a Czechoslovakian chick
She was acting cocky and shit
She like watching blow at the hotel
With big dreams to never stop being rich
And she wasn't too sloppy with dick
Said when she get on she gonna cop me a six
Platinum blue Sprewell shoes
Detail smooth
On some Mickey and Mallory me and my female cruise
Type of demo what's the bi-no
I Gave her two-six plus ten-four
That's twelve-five for the brick
And five-hundred for the plane and limo
Plain and simple
Call my guy told him thanks and send more
Meditating plot on my lick when I smell them frankincense blow
Do my thugdizzle
I ain't scared of this
Fly your head like Pegasus
Bloody up that necklace
Hope I'm an arrow ?
Them terrorist
Fucked up the lick when sending chicks on the plane
Put a major glitch in the game
But I'm a get me them thangs
As I come with new ways to travel watch my shorties get on them
Coming back with pounds and packages with the scorpions on them
Of course we been on them
Niggas know they two for forty and want them
I done seen truck loads with more keys than accordions on them
And you think I'm a pass up
That quick fast dust
Let me mask up
That ain't a fast truck
Get your ass stuffed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I spit words that be gangster shit
Make hustlers tip and ballers rich
Haters sick, mobsters hit
I'm the shit
You can see me visit the optometrist
Cars I flip
Unorthodox like Doctor Bonovich
Prada lick
But a nigga got whooped
Should have seen shit was funny
My own connection he got reason to gun me
I know he took the money
Even if I probably wrong
Turn down the volume
Shoot him on plastic to lay his body on
Fucking maricón
Two to the cabeza
Pinche puto
That ring on your pinky was too cold
Got pinch for two O's
And a half a brick
My staff is sick
Had him confess like a catholic
Always thought things was funny now you don't laugh at shit
Stupid bastard bitch
Never fuck with Twista, Turtle Banxx and Stokes
Coming up dro flowing slanging dope
I tried to chill
But when I see a lick to make the world mine
ON the love
I think I got to pull it

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
'Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not for nothing
I know you're looking for something
And I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby you're awesome
Also, I'm also awesome, also

And I'd rather do nothing with you

Stop everything you're doing now

You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking ?, oh it feels so right




[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

[Chorus: Rihanna]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money, ooh?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency

[Chorus: Rihanna]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Bridge: Big Sean]
So good, so good, Westside, so hood
I do it.. B. I.... G

[Verse 3: Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that, all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite

[Verse 1]
And I'm just tryin' to play it cool
Wonderin' what you gon' do now
It's 11:15 and, baby, I got to hit you up
Are you playin' around? Oh, what now?
Tell me what's that's
12:35 and you sayin' that you ain't been to text
And that you're on your way, well, okay, okay
What I'm sayin', don't say it, don't say it
Now it's 1:15 and, baby, you got to be playin'
Baby, you have got to be playin'
Where are you?
Are you comin' back? Still callin' through
And she say she at the club with her girl
And it's her girl's birthday and she keepin' her there longer
And, uh, you know how that goes
And she want to see me so bad
Oh, so she's leavin' in about fifteen minutes
After this, uh, one favorite Pitbull song plays, goes off
Or some shit like that, now it's like, uh, 2:45
And you know what type of textses niggas send at that time
I texted her and I said, "Are you alive?"
That's when you send that text
And you say, "Hey, are you alive?"
Cause the only reason why you not here
Bitch, you better have died
Bitch, you better have died
Bitch, you better have died
Now it's like 3:30 and you tell me that you're on your way
And a nigga so goddamn horny
You know what I said? "Okay"
I'm just sayin', "Okay"
Who you gon' listen to: Your ego or your dick?
Now the dick wins
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
And I can't understand, holdin' a white wine
BlackBerry in my hand
Lookin' at the time, 7 a.m
I can't believe this bitch sent me through this shit again
Oh, you got me, huh?
Are you gon' give me every chance you get?
You gon' give me every chance you get?
I don't know when you're gonna quit
This why I left your ass in the first place
This why I helped your ass in the first case
And you don't have the nerve to text a nigga
I left the door cracked open
New York City is dangerous, I could have been robbed
New York City is dangerous, I could have been robbed
What you think?
I would take that chance for some pussy moanin'
This the type of pussy you risk your life for
This the type of pussy you need your wife for
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
And lookin' back, tryin' spend the night over
And I'll admit it
Even though I'm disrespected as a motherfucker
I still, still want to hit it
Got an ass like that cause I paid your ass again
My friends say, "What the fuck is wrong with them?"
Cause ain't no sex like a ex
Ain't no sex like your ex
Ain't no sex like your ex, ain't no sex like
You know, cause you'd be so mad at that motherfucker
And you know they got a new motherfucker
And you know you just want to fuck her
And prove that the next nigga ain't as good as you
And he can't do what you do
So, baby, if you give me one chance to dance
Put the devil in a purple light
If you give me one chance to dance
Put the devil in a purple light
Alright, don't say, don't say
Where she'll stop, I'll never know, don't say
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
So, hey, so, hey
Don't say you, don't say you will
Hey, don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, don't say, don't say, don't say you will, you will

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls"
"All of the lights," she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"
[—Chloe Mitchell]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

["The Best Birthday": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]
Ohh, my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfucking level!
Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
Goddamn, Goddamn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My—my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you, motherfucking butt-ass-naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now! Shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before!"
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him. I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well
Yeezy taught you well




[Intro]
Kanye to The, yeah, you heard the name
Checks plus raps finna murder the game, uh
Can y'all get it? Fuck y'all
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
All these niggas believe
They breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only difference though, I fuck better hoes
Iceberg clothes, I got to pose
Every whip with the studio in a hospital
This nigga flow is very sick
Plus very rich hoes, very thick chain, very thick
Feel like I could fuck every bitch
Twenties at the bottom, carry the six
If I cop back, then shot him, I buried him six
You can't hate this nigga with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
Plus your taste is rather tasteless
Test my aim and watch me ace this
You wack rap cats need a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
Reach down to my Timbs, grab my laces
Got loops on niggas, y'all want a tight noose on niggas
If I ain't holler at you for (?), niggas
What the fuck I got to do, another truth for niggas?
See, it don't really matter what y'all prove to niggas
Y'all ain't satisfied 'til we shoot some niggas
So if somebody got to die, tell me who want it
That Chi-Town, South Side bullshit, we on it

[Hook]
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop, then froze
I got to pose

[Verse 2]
Man, bitch, I ain't finished with your ass
Heavy all night, spendin' cash at the ball
At the show and before we got back
At the gas station buyin' your ass snacks
At the liquor store buyin' act right juice
So when we get bid-ad, you know how to hit that
Next time, bring some friends for me to get at
But no fat hoes, you expect me to hit that?
Molly set me up like, "K got scratched"
Run up in the crib mad, stuck with that
Y'all niggas talk that, but y'all don't really lit that
So I had to hit them with the flat out, get your ass out
You tuned in with the boss of the bosses
NFL, no fuckin' losses
Chain flossless, fuck with it cost us
We go broke, we take y'all for hostage

[Hook]
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop and froze
I got to pose

[Verse 3]
You see me rollin', smokin', coastin', boastin'
Plus a little gone off the potion
Oh, and known for flossin' a little too often
Might end up in a coffin
I'm floatin' cause I don't smoke like that
Y'all niggas want to plot, we don't joke like that
Faggot-ass niggas get approached like that
Matter of fact, murder gettin' wrote like that
I'm finna take these niggas back to the streets
Back to hoppin' out the 'Lac with the heat
Back to the fifty, posin' with some bitches
In front of that airbrushed 2Pac picture

[Hook]
Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
And then she drop and froze




[Intro: Kanye West]
Bang. Let it bang. Yeah, let it bang. Uh uh uh yeah. Hey uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I ain't tryin' to stress my wealth
But sometimes I gotta American Express myself
When the pastor asked me why I'm flashy
Well, sometimes I gotta bless myself
I see you shining, shining like a mirror ball
Why when we're abroad we don't never hear of y'all?
You local retard, I'm the king of the world
So the king of your city by default
Niggas pullin' out cash in wads
My pants kinda tight, only fit, a credit card
But please don't get to spazzin' on 'em
Really Doe got a different type of plastic on him
And all my niggas, is big tippers
Why? A little rain never hurt no strippers
And it ain't like I can't get along with you
But I need you to get along while I get richer
Speakin' of richer you talkin' bout prior
Let's talk about now and the future which I am
All star ah, Super Bowl shuffle
Suicide door ah, big world tour ah
I am the menorah of this new era
And uh, you are?, dawg, whatever
Got to excuse the cockiness
But only an asshole can give you this much shit

[Hook: Really Doe]
Don't make me swipe my card
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
I know you star, stuntin' for these broads
Nigga don't make me swipe my card
Peep the ice game
What the fuck? Are you a retard?
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
Nigga don't make me swipe my card

[Verse 2: Really Doe]
It's no fair he's not
No nigga bring the thunder
Make your account look like social security numbers
I fast yesterday, now you feel my hunger
Why you grillin' the Hummer?
Can it be yours, you wonder
I'm on top and you're so far under
Dodgin piranha's swimmin' with them fish
Chicken, Salmon, yeah my favorite dish
Mess the kitchen up and I don't have to touch a dish
I suggest you disperse, take a guest list
Henny, Remy, bottles of Cris
Miss, do you know who in this bitch?
Handle that, I swung my wrist
Look my name up, find me in the Ritz
That's cause I'm stuntin' with more labels than cars on All Star Weekend
Awe baby we ballin', glasses over here are kinda low
Don't stall

[Hook: Really Doe]
Don't make me swipe my card
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
I know you star, stuntin' for these broads
Nigga don't make me swipe my card
Peep the ice game
What the fuck? Are you a retard?
Nigga quit playin' before I swipe my card
Nigga don't make me swipe my card

[Outro: Really Doe]
Man, just so you niggas don't get it confused
I ain't talkin' about lean cards either
It's got to have one of these logos: American Express, Master, Visa

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
I'm so tired of all the cries, I'm so tired of sinful light
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Vore the night
And maybe you'll get away tonight
And maybe then the night's alright
And maybe you'll want something of mine
And we'll get on and get by
And maybe we'll learn to belong too
And maybe we'll learn to will mine
'Cause I can't depend on the now new
And these niggas don't come tonight
Roll your guns up, roll your guns up
They got guns so you're gonna come
Roll up your guns up, and nothin' left to do, but

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV sta-tion

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Alright, sometimes the day's too long
Where would you go?

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
If you're tired of all the lies, if you're tired of all the cries
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
Now if your signs aren't all that nice n' if you find someone for life
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

[Outro: Kanye West]
And if you're tired of all the lies n' then you're tired of all the cries
It won't consign until all we die
And when you drab I'm still alive, still alive
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, yeah, yeah

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking

[Kanye]
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

"... last call for alcohol, for my niggas"

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"

No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."

[JAY-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]

"Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"

[JAY-Z: "so what you think of this?"]

And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: "Come on, let's just go"]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

[Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"

[Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, "Man that was tight."

[JAY-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, "Naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

["Y'all niggas is stupid"]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."

[Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"

[Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

[Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"

[Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer-rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

[Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"

So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...




[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates So know I got elevens and twelves With at least
Thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead That you know don't like you? She'll run over your head with a motorcycle I mean the way you look is
Nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo She said "He gay anyway, you don't know nothin'
About Jamario"

[Hook]




[Intro]
It's no facade or no chapard
Well acquainted with Audemars and all that shit
It's Ricky Ross the rich boss

[Verse 1]
Wet bars on the boat, what broad won't elope
Crib like Scott Storch all from the coke
Maybachs were a dream now it's all real
It's hard to get sleep layin' next to five mil
Still got the chills, I call 'em the goosebumps
Yeah Alexander vision, I'm buildin' like two Trumps
Steppin' guce bumps I'm the main event
We got a pocket full of game, brain it made me ten
Six bitches' numbers all on the same napkin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it these niggas livin' of the past
I ran a hundred miles but I did it all with class
Hands all glass, wrist all glass
Mirror on the wall, how long will the crystal last
Champagne pours, celebrate the cause
Hover above the laws at the mercy of the Lord

[Hook]
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga

[Verse 2]
What's worse, a testimony from you homie?
Tables turn fast, I told you not to fuck me, Tony
Started with the dishes, endin' with the digits
I had to cross friendship, it's rules to the business
All the time with a sister like Gina
Beauty salon dream, got the keys and the Beamer
On the way to cheetahs pointin' an army
Land my spaceship with the spoilers only
Seen the UFOs, FBI, ATF, let ‘em know how a nigga ride
Fo-fo and fo-five and six fo's
Half a pill, two dime, six hoes
I need a slice of the pie, fo five six
As I throw my dice in the sky
Head crack nigga
Bread stack nigga
Convertible Bert yeah I let my hair back nigga

[Hook]
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga

[Verse 3]
Lamborghinis and Maseratis for mediocres
When the beat's over, back to the street, soldier
Call cold shoulders might make me bring the heats over
When the beef's over, might see the peach rover
We eats but we try to reach each quota
No soda, Rolls roller one on her
Rodeo eighty gram, one coda
Louis Vuitton, bright sides don’t want ‘em
They trippin', I’m drippin' in Tiffany stones
Get a mop, Peter prop, I’m livin' it homes
Chauffeur I blow purp and no skirts
Four chains I’m puttin' down with more work

[Hook]
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga

[Seal]
Come sweetly, stab me through the shadow of an open door
Wait quietly now, take us to the helplessness of it all
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
Wonder if the only thing left is love
Wonder if I ever will wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[John Legend]
Oh, lie to me
Lie to me, tell me I'm not wasting time
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, convince me you miss me
Your heart still beats as fast as mine
Tell me lies
We loved it, loved it even more than we knew
We lost it, and I don't even know what to do
Tell me what to do
Cause I wonder why it had to slip away somehow
I wonder if you'll ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever be the same

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?


[Bridge]
Oh, you eyes haunt me, taunt me, pierce straight through my heart again
Will it ever end?
Cause I

[Seal + John Legend]
Wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?




[Snoop Dogg]
A pool party at the church
G'd up and others barbequeing
Ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
Chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks
Everybody swimming, backyard full of women
I'm entertaining folks
Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy
Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
To pop some fireworks with my kids
And fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion

It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
Yeah, we like blood brothers
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

[Hook - Latoiya Williams]
We made it through winter
We made it through fall
We made it through the spring time
Tough times and all
It's good to see
Another Summer
I'm riding with the top down
Let the wind blow
Chillin' with my love
Partying fo' sho'
It feels good to see
Another Summer
Everybody if you with me sing

[Nate Dogg]
We got the game on lock
On the paper chase, can't stop
On a roll, still hot
Gotta be top notch
I like the girls 'cuz they hot
Plus I know what they want
They want the game that we got
Hold up baby girl I think not
I like the nasty girls from around the way
Hoppin' in my gray drop-top Mercedes
Shouts go out to my sexy ladies
Just in case your man is hating
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)

[Hook]

[Warren G]
I'm addicted to the sunshine the way it make these women dress
Tank tops, flip flops, make this nigga love the west
Different spots, even though different, it's still crackin'
In Jamaica, Queens I sit back, live and collect the cabbage
It's an affair that every state can relate to
And if you do what I do, then go on and follow suit
From Chi-Town to Diego, all the way back to NY
Stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine
When I'm at the church I barbeque for my kinfolk
Watch lil' Elijah and lil' Warren run the football
Got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
And it's a blessin' that the world wanna hear our music
The summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
And to my my nigga Snoopdewoop, I love you fam'

[Snoop Dogg]
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, another summer
Kanye West good looking on the beat, nephew
213 reminding y'all put your guns down
Real spit it's summertime, let's enjoy ourselves
We just wanna celebrate
You know what I'm talking about?
It's too hot for all that
Yeah 213
Moving mountains y'all haha
All the time, yeah




[Produced by Devo Springsteen, John Legend, Kanye West]

[Intro]
Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

[Verse 1]
This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 2]
To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 3]
Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outer Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a Nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like [?] to 'em
Aye yo, I've got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Before I lose it and have to prove it
This the way that we gon', time; we gotta move it to the future
Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya
Don't shoot ya, stop the violence and it's been stopped
We stopped the violence in the hip-hop
We stopped the hatin' and the degradation
We 'bout to build like One Nation
Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
Cause they say, "Ye, don't play that"
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye Juice
That's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy
And moved my family when I was 3
And in the cold, straight from Chicago where I go
And everybody know, from my homie Don C, I be air
Aye, yo, like IBM or Apple, Steve Jobs of this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Aye, yo, it's very, very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel, I can do it every tempo
I'll use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build churches
That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is
Aye, yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed, motherfuckers
It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect
And now you know it's still worth it
I might short-circuit, I might just black out
Hit you with that "BLOCKA!"
You know I'm Ibaka
Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Because God on my side, that's the way I ride
Jesus Christ, Yeezus nice!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
One time I had lost my faith
But I had to stay faithful and grateful for the God I was given
The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'
It didn't make a difference
See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents
Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather
Mother, father, now I've only got one parent
Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent
But still you've got to stay strong
I don't know what everybody else is on
Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out
Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now
And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything
But see, I wanna do everything
And I know I could do everything
And be anything that I wanna be
So simply, if you wanna be like Mike
I wanna be like Christ, I wanna be that nice
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, this beat just threw me off
Took it extra old-school
This ain't no freestyle beat, yo, yo, dude!




[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
Coldest story ever told
And somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
Mmm, could you be so heartless?
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
Need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
I know I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend – well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
Coldest story ever told
And somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak and so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
Wait a couple of months, then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
Coldest story ever told
And somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
I got somethin' new to see
You just gon' keep hatin' me
We just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
So I'm gon' make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night...

[Chorus]
I hear 'em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?
Mmm, how could you be so heartless?

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Hey y'all
I came to talk about this girl that had my love
You see, I went away for a while
And she gave my love away
And I really shouldn’t blame her
But now, that pussy is a stranger

[Verse 1: Lloyd & Lil Wayne]
Baby (hah!)
Something's on my mind I gotta say it
Yeah, your pussy done changed
It ain't the same girl and that's a shame (a crying shame baby)
Ooh, ain't being funny (mm-mm)
I know another bee’s been in that honey (dang!)
Ooh baby, that pussy done changed (pussy done changed)
It’s such a shame (pussy done changed) girl and that's a shame (hah!)
Who the hell you been giving my loving to, girl?

[Hook: Lloyd & Lil Wayne]
Oh no, tell me where that pussy gone
Oh no, cause it don’t feel the same no more
I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy
Oh no (why you do me like that baby?)
Oh no, why is that happening to me?
Oh no, she told me that it was my pussy
I miss that pussy (my pussy) that pussy (that pussy)
That pussy (good pussy) that pussy (that pussy)
Oh no, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Lloyd & Lil Wayne]
She (uhh)
She used to be a really special lady (my everything)
I guess she’s feeling kinda freaky lately
It’s such a shame cause now the pussy’s changed (mm-mm-mm)
That pussy changed, yeah yeah
She used to squeeze me (hooo!)
Grip me tight enough so she can please me
But now, now, now that pussy changed (pussy done changed)
It’s such a shame (pussy done changed) that pussy changed, naw!

[Hook: Lloyd & Lil Wayne]
Oh no, where did ya pussy go? (Where's it at, baby?)
Oh no, cause girl, I need to know
I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy (hah!)
Oh no, you see, it was on some old one-of-a-kind type shit baby
Oh no, I’m about to kill this bitch
Oh no, she gave away all my shit
I miss that pussy (good pussy) that pussy (new pussy)
That pussy (I miss that) that pussy (old pussy)
Oh no, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Damn, darlin', do change your oil
I’m your number one fan-belt, they are not important
I don’t use a cordless, microphone avoid 'em
They don’t feel real to me, meaning real woman
Others peeled on me, you the primer
On the lime bean green box when I couldn’t afford a Ford
Clean socks scooting 'cross the floor in your
Grandmama house, hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante
This mechanic's so uncanny, X-Men, X-Men
Your ex-boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
Know I can't bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please but
Can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they gon' put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happen in a Hyatt?
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker, you think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Bet your buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia? Fuck it, our future is dead

[Outro: Lloyd & Lil Wayne]
Oh no (I thought a pussy cat had 9 lives man) I need to know
Oh no, yeah yeah yeah yeah (hahahah)
I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy
Oh no (that pussy) oohhh
Oh no, I'm about to kill this bitch
Oh no, she gave away all my shit
I miss that pussy (my pussy) that pussy (that pussy)
That pussy (that pussy) that pussy (my pussy)
Oh no, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hahahahah, yeah, I miss ya girl
Fuck that bitch! Hahahahaha




[Hook: Kanye West]
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin

[Hook]




[Verse 1: Kanye West]

Uh, I don't need no little ass
I need a ghetto ass girl
With a car that can make it 'cross town with just a little gas
I know when we first met, you was a little gassed
But you want to keep your swag
So you was holding back
Your little brother love me
He say, "Yeezy got some fresh clothes"
Your grandmother love me
Cause I always dress in dress clothes
I can switch your dress code
Change your life like, "presto"
I am like that Aston Martin engine, you just press "go"
Why you acting like you ain't impressed for
Oh, see why you listen to the press though?
I ain't finna explain my life up on no Larry King
Cause when I show her that thing
She said, "that explains everything"
Everything
That just changed everything
Yeezy on her name ring
Yeezy where her chain bling
Yeah, I throw Barack up, but
Baby, you get my vote
Love a ghetto girl with more ass than the models

[Bridge: Kanye West]

See, see, see I did the screwed up shit myself
I ain't put no affect, no
You know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Ay, ay, ay gonna thump 'm thump
When I thump I'm thumpin' on the old game
I can thump, thump, do some, something 'till they sold me
Turn that bitch to a Soul Train
I'll get a thump with the old stain
Want to just slap that cocaine
Like a cold king, someone who just sound like, "okay"
Okay, I get it, I pound it, I spit it, now I'm throwin' up
I'm gonna, wanna something, 'till I got my moana
And then I'm gonna....




[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm goin' in circles
You're like a maze I can't get through
Should I go left? Should I go right?
Should I let you stay for the night?
It's like a seesaw when it comes to your love
Boy, when you're up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me

[Verse 2]
I'm goin' out with guys I don't wanna go
To places that I've been before
They pitchin' the same game
Boy, it's a damn shame
How I wish it was you callin' me
I want it to be you holdin' me
Boy, it needs to be you kissin' me
'Cause it's like a seesaw, when it comes to your love
Boy, when you're up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me

[Bridge]
Listen
Have your way with me anytime, anywhere
Have your way however, I don't care
Have your way with me
And you can have it tonight
Tonight, tonight, boy, tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me




[Verse 1: Freeway]
When you come, you niggas know what it is
I let you keep your girl, bro, but with your boys, it's a no go
Throgh slugs at your wig, I get back at you
Knock your block off, smack up your kids
Make it like Shane-O, ain't no shame here
When your with your boys, I throgh gats at their ribs
Get it back in the doe
Use guns that'll blow your brains to the back of your wig
9 4 G pack on your porch, and in the back of your block
Now I'm 3, layed in the back of the Porsh
Stop at your block, make it like Nas
I make feends holler at moms

[Chorus: Freeway and Beanie Sigel]
Philly niggas that'll dap the crime
Chilly niggas since we linked with Rock
You silly niggas, not Philly niggas that'll squeeze the Glocc
Philly niggas that'll dab the gon
Chilly niggas since we linked with Jay
Ya'll silly niggas, south PHilly niggas, we bust the K

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
I blast metal that'll go through your ribs, you fagget niggas straight go in a house, blast an explosive
Bring you niggas straight out of your crib
Bullet fragments all in your mouth, face off, C4, that'll level you out
Fuck your stainless steal door, nigga, I'll metal it out
We got connects at the range, hot metal, we out
Connect the dot, say Bean, we level it out
Pushin beams through your window, scanning
Your house
We even scan when you standing on your couch
We in there, out there, like a robbery, planned it out
Escape roofs, never land in the house
The big rumble snake moves, niggas talk about when they get out
So if you scared, say you scared, is you in, or is you out
Fuck the maximom pentimom house
I'm comin into your house, 2 gats, me and Mack, gettin back

[Chorus: Freeway and Beanie Sigel]
Philly niggas that'll dap the crime
Chilly niggas since we linked with Rock
You silly niggas, not Philly niggas that'll squeeze the Glocc
Philly niggas that'll dab the gon
Chilly niggas since we linked with Jay
Ya'll silly niggas, south PHilly niggas, we bust the K

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mmm, ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, these niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back, I'm just tryna protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy": Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, to the world

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah, hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me

[Produced by Kanye West, Devo Springsteen and Jon Brion]

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me

[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, 'cause

[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dawg, "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Ha ha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear
Sayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
(I'm Young, bitches!) Good night!




[Refrain: Fred Hammond]
Hand 'em
Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for you my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for you my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers
Only halfway read Ephesians
Only if they knew what I knew, uh
I was never new 'til I knew of
True and living God, Yeshua
The true and living God
(Somebody pray for me)

[Refrain: Fred Hammond]
Hand 'em
Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on

[Verse 2: Fred Hammond & Kanye West]
I deserve all the criticism you got
If that's all the love you have, that's all you got
To sing of change, you think I'm joking
To praise His name, you ask what I'm smoking
Yes, I understand your reluctancy, yeah
But I have a request, you see
Don't throw me up, lay your hands on me
Please, pray for me
Hold myself on death
Hold it down, all fallen down
Somebody pray for me

[Refrain: Fred Hammond]
Hand 'em
Hands up high, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands up
In your face, the reason
Hands on, yeah, hands on




Verse 1
Amen amen who's yelling halluya in no church
Blessed by the street not by the power of God
I don't go to church cause I'm sceard of been judge
Temptions in the street got my high work out know
Load it up to banga Banga with no foreign hoes
Kept by the keys the great power of the hustler
Mona Lisa had painted the picture
Tell me what you like I don't need no feature
I'm grand that I'm feeling so distance
The measure the pleasure is all mine
Kod stay out of it
He go make say things you never said it
And I'm sure you can't even remember anything
I'm that nigga who gotta fate and promises that turned into lies
By the time i realised it it  all gone

Ama let gun be by guns
I'm fade Away
Who got gyals singing err song
You receiving them gyals sing on
Cause all you wanted is singing them tune
That you never had
Busy madetting  your idoz
When you can make that Ido sing for you
Jump on a private jet never worry bout none
If you worry to much you are losing part of you
You gotta gyals
And gotta niggas
They gonna turn it up when rap
They gonna be with me when down
Chaotic and u welcome
Tatted my face with tats
On my face
When I'm hurt I don't feel no pressure
Cuz stress gotta me incize
I'm your life icon you better save me like Jesus
If you ain't talking bout the money let me out
Ama beat you out like I'm beating this beat



Chorus
Pistor in my head gotta me thinking like the bread winner
I don't need no shit just pass the coke cokene
Three roll better than zero rollz
I call that my major  three rolls
Black out in my Bentley couple
Cause I don't see nobody down with
It
Just saved a coin in my hundred dollar just to boost out
And I ain't sceard to puk ass niggas
A no nigga like me you never find a better nigga like me
I beat myself to death so I can see the short away to heaven


Verse 2
I'm all bout Manchester
Take all my evil plans to my grave
Call 911 the bottom is full of shit
Hate you when you losing love when you hit that top
Keep move that dope
Riot myself till death
In the grave yard 04 digging for my bones then I found my gold
Like niggas like me can never be no cow
My passion is strong you can't beat my thoughts
At this age in my brain there is only big shit
If you try to comphend it your deep thoughts will sink
Nowadays mama I do go to church cause I'm sceard of begin judged
Miss lead my life with passion I knew won't last
I rather put my own heart in my bleed
Cause the Moment I let it out it will split
And if you gotta be my wife you gotta be my homie
I ask you who you seeing with
But you still on that lying thing
Can't believe you so selfish
Don't ever try to break the part of my heart with your living lies
Baby work your heart out and find your inner peace
You lead me to love you
And I loved you more than you thought
Your looks are deserving
Everything bout you is so deserving
I thought I was the one taught to your soul but you broke it
And I feel so disconnected
You played my heart like rocking ball
You everything I ever wanted
That was not even funny

Chorus

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uh, H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed, it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Hook: Jay-Z]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda (with Chester Bennington)]
Check it out, yo
(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, (All I know)
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away and (It's so unreal)
I didn't look out below
I watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to (Watch you go)
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried, so

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, help me up
Oh they havin good old time out there
It starts with

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yo Jin! We good wit this one, yeah

[Intro 2: Jin]
Good looking Kanye, Ruff Ryder, Roc-A-Fella collabo
You see, we're the next generation in this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this

[Hook: Kanye West]
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

[Verse 1: Jin]
Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is, so basically the Chi and M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
The kid that 'Dropped Outta College', the other never went
We take turns doing our one, two's and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name, tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West, what do you think is the best?
(Kanye: Take em backstage, get aquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it comes to spittin G, I'm one of the best y'all
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me, no

[Hook: Kanye West]
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

[Verse 2: Jin]
I got a - way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci Parka, ma what did you say
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today, hey
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low, got Play-Doh, stash the payroll
Ain't no - credit card, spendin cash on Rodeo
And me? I'm at the Slauson Swap Meet
Lookin for a pair of Air One's and white tee's
She want champagne, I got Sisco and Kool-Aid
Why go to the movies? let's watch the bootleg

[Hook: Kanye West]
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

[Verse 3: Jin]
Girl I don't wear Prada, never met Gucci
Or wore Versake [Versace], y'all is too boughi
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V, I'd think that it's on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin, why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me)
Actually, you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign, you don't want the matching hat
Huh, I'm too gutter, you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the - other - suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change

[Hook: Kanye West]
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

These niggas wanna wonder what they have on me?

(Why are we...late)
It's like every thought I think is equivalent to a dollar
If I lost 10 million, I'd shrivel into a baller (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Money never smaller, stacks taller than Jordan's father
My wallet be lookin pregnant, Ben Franklin gonna have a daughter
Holla, if you ever mess with my dollars
You'll be pissed on like your name was Isiah Thomas
Your label took your album, threw it up in the air and they shot it (blaow)
Now that the rap game is rotted, I gotta do somethin 'bout it (Why are we...late)
I was movin mixtapes, while Dre was movin the "Chronic"
Started movin millions, soon as Kanye's moved into "College"
I can take ya overseas in the villas that look exotic
You would think it's open bar how the water look like Hypnotiq (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm the "Million Dollar Man", my money movin "Bionic"
Fast like the month of what Ramadan do if you Islamic (yeah) (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Bow down to the Mecca, the minute the kid is spotted

I make sure the feet stay with a pedicure, keep 'em polished (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Am I not the best to come out of Houston Man be honest
How come my name in they mouth more than they orthodontist (Oh oh oh oh oh)
If I say that I'm the best, then just know that I'm bein honest
If I say I'm filthy rich, then just know that I'm bein modest (Oh oh oh oh oh)
You doubt it, just think about it, success gonna assist my promise
I'm able to pull unlimited digits out of my wallet (Why are we...late)
My digits ain't got no limits, my digits turn into commas
My crib so big in mileage, your mansion look like a cottage (haha) (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Uh, better not tell me you ain't got it
If money you owe's the topic, if money you owe's the topic
If money you owe's the topic, you better come through and drop it
Better pull somethin outta your ass (outta your ass), like a colonic
When ya fail, they all yell, so that y'all sound like some riots
The crowd goes wild, the "Victory's" been decided (Why are we...late)
Platinum makes 'em be quiet, you wish that you had some silence
(*silence for 3 seconds*)
Not Gangsta Boo, I ain't gotta ask "Where Da Dollars At " (where da dollars at )
I could show you exactly where the dollars stacks (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I have you pacin, I'm navigatin, like I'm a map
Like mapquest with the moula, when it come down to that (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Y'all tried to wish me out the spot, but I'm still here
Have to have cheated cause this life don't even feel fair (yeah) (Why are we...late)
Pushin the chrome like I'm rollin on a wheelchair
My money longer than the Bin Laden beard hair (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm still rippin up the game, do you hear the tear (tear)
The world still round and y'all still square (Oh oh oh oh oh)

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
(So excit—so excit—so excit—so excit—)

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?
(21st-Century schizoid man)




[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]
I know you see me now, right now (You see me now, right now)
I know you see me now, right now (You see, you see)
I know you see me now, right now (Haha, yeah)
I know you see me now, right now

[Bridge 1: Beyoncé & Kanye West]
I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said "Hell no"
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Kanye West)]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shopping, dog, let's celebrate)
But I don’t, no matter how good it gets, it’ll never be like before
(Free Weezy though)
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it’s loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it’s going down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she’s lookin' down right now

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I’m in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

[Bridge 3: Beyoncé & Kanye West]
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I’ma make it hot 'til it’s time to go
When it’s time to go, where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Exactly
Rosewood
Aha, aha
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O, now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Whoadie, holy moley went, from G-Shockin' to Rollie
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Nah, nah, baby boy, you Jody, in the party, they all know me
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was lookin' like the old me
Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel
She gave me designer, uh, she keep it au natural
I say it again, I'm chasin' cheese, dodgin' rat traps
Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like, 'Ye protégé?
He sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls
We be gettin' paid like W-2
Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
"We love you Sean," I love you too
Ooh-ooh, you know I do

[Outro: Kanye West]
Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
I know Jet magazine calling right now
You looking good today too, I like that
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on
I know you thinking, “This that Yeezy we all love”
I’m back, baby, we back, baby
Uncle Charlie, by the way
And I’ma let you finish, but I got Beyoncé on the track
That’s what it is
Black excellence, baby
This is the elite
We the greatest in the world baby, we the greatest in the world!!!
Hahahahaha
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy
Uh




Yo! Alright I'm about to murder this beat right here




[Intro]
E-yeah-yeah-yeah (Oh)
Whoa
E-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse]
I just seen lil' mama Instagram and she flexin'
Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breastses
Oh girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
The world has gone to shit and we all know that
People freakin' out, like, hit the Prozac
Leon DeChino shorts got all the blogs mad
Well, fuck the internet, and you can quote that, whoa

[Chorus]
Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Outro]
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound




[Sample]
My world came to an end
And then you came back
I think you brought it back together
Now I know
There is no (there is no)
Way (there's no there is no way)
That I can go on without you baby

[Verse One: Kanye West]
Yeah, history in the makin, Do or Die
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin' at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin' on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
That's how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin' at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur

[Verse Two]
Off the block now
Shit got the pipe down
Industry niggas I just got bomb
Track from Kanye West pass the bomb aye
Kick the doors down like Desert Storm
Where's the millions
I'm the chameleon
Transformatin', rock a show like God
Drivin' for status
Big my apparatus
You gotta now I'm getting all that dough
Hotter than your shit
Bullshit, got a full clip
Think I'm a punk then get your back broke slow
I'm the shiznick down to my diznick
Lyrics so hot enough for frozen snow
Feel of the bomb again and get fucked the he say she say
He say she say I ain't gon make it
The throne is my mine
Chi-town where's the crown
From the days of Capone, nigga
You know we gon take it
I wanna vint Vivian and own my own block
Print my check like Johnny Walker Scott
Damn if you do or you don't you move over
Save some room for the black Casanova

Ladies and gentlemen. You is tunin' in to Do Or Die (thank you) Kanye West
Chi-town finest. World clap your hands for us one time
It's the world premiere, You don't understand though
Man we got the plan. We gon put it in your hands like this
It ain't nothing happenin'. You know what I'm sayin'?
We make it happen. Bullshit ain't nothing Joe. Chi-town finest
You know how it go. Come on. Come on
Uh, come on, come on

[Verse Three]
This the last time you see my like this here stuntin'
16,5 & 3 ain't that somethin'?
As long as we makin the paper the hoes comin'
Suppose I get behind the mic and flow somethin'
Kanye show the chain ladies expose something
With a hummer H2 with the Benz there's no frontin'
With some ice you can skate on
Now I got no weight on
It's gettin to the point when the ballas try hate on
Proticops I stayed on
And made a lot of hot songs
Do you think I'm a P.I.M.P
In a SL5 Halle Berry colors scoop me
Groupies and Gucci you know you can't exclude me
Ladies get around be like "He's so cool G"
No I'm not booshie just Eric and Young Stoopie
The black Hugh Heffner

[Verse Four]
Tell me tell me Lord can you hear me?
Sometimes I walk these streets and get weary
Most of the times I can't let these niggas get near me
With this hatred, jealousy, and envy
I went to church and they said you had a remedy
A remedy to set me free and take away my enemies
So I pray to the day when I get to see
All the faces that put me down up in the industry
So from the street to the club
It's ya boy show me love
We gotta keep it gangstas that's how we gettin love
Never fall for the love of the dough
Stay true, straight to the facts and the game to show
Sample




[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh
Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double M-O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem
Hardcore since I was next door to Clem and them
Cold as the winter when fake niggas was shiverin'
Shakin' in they Timberlands, you as played as Bennigans
Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
I been a master since P was No Limitin
Stick to sayin'
No gimmickin' and no mimickin'
Q infinitin' down old blocks are bendin in
Yellin' "Fuck tha police" like Ren and them
Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid
Noble like Drew Ali
Many have come
But few have been chose to be a true MC
You sing along with it, inside you knowin' it's wack
Young who? Oh, he the openin' act

[Verse 2]
Let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go
It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles
Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin' notes for my homies, fuck a motto
And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
Your live show is hollow, should've kept it local
Rappin' over vocals
Soundin' soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's the gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer
Feel the passion of this B-boy rationale
Half of it is what you say and half is style
I guess it's time for you to start cashin' out
It's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down
Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest
Performances keep me stackin' the sheets

[Verse 3]
The name is Com I’m like a rebel in rap
Struggle music mixed with weed to make the ghetto react
I know they wanna Resurrect but I ain’t pedalin' back
They gangster stories just as real as Kevin Federline rap
I guess it’s Kramer and Bush that don’t care about blacks
Kinda wish it was some real niggas there that just snapped
Meanwhile in the mean world, hoes cry freedom and fiends url
I’m standing supreme like the Dreamgirls
And I’m tellin you like Jennifer Hudson
The law get outta pocket then I’ma be buckin’
Goin’ against me joe is self-destruction
I’m tired of y'all like my man is of hustlin’
Shuckin’ and jivin', gon’ do that dance nigga
30 with kids pull up ya pants nigga
I ran with the brothers from around the 7
I can tell who’s live by soundcheckin'




[Intro 1: Blades of Glory sample]
We're going to skate to one song...one song only
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me

[Intro 2: T.I.]
Aye man I don't know what been happening
I guess y'all must have caught amnesia in my absence
I ain't been gone that long, have I?
Well, just for y'all reminder
How about the crown meet the throne right here
Let's get it

[Verse 1: T.I. & JAY-Z]
Call me T.I. -- no CPR, I'm killing shit
Even in prison I'm still the shit
Better recognize King in the building bitch
Act like you know you serious, I (ball so hard)
My ankle hurt, don't buy a car if I ain't the first
In the country with a 1, 2, 3 bitch
You watch me while I painted her, I (Ball so hard)
They hate to see me on the stage Jay-Z, Kanye with me
You know I (ball so hard), TIP is scary
Merci beaucoup in Paris
Parlez vous francais I say, Menage a trois today I say
I (ball so hard), hard out the park
Maybach chauffeured, I ain't got to park
So Ross, so official dawg
Them lame can't do nothing with you dawg
She all on me, better get your broad
Don't like that, blow your whistle dawg, I (ball so hard)
No referee throw no flag, ain't no techs for me
I keep them suckas upset with me, them racks back on deck you best believe that I

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me, first niggas got to find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me, can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy, y'all don't know that don't shit phase me
The Nets could go 0 for 82 and I look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird, we ain't even supposed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here, it's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escape what I've escaped, you'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose, I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Verse 3: Kanye]
She said, "'Ye can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all"
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it Jay? What she order, fish filet?
(Ball so hard) "Your whip so cold!" This old thing?
Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand, fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French but I’m in France, I’m just sayin'
Prince William ain’t do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my deala? What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest, cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh!

[Interlude]
I don't even know what that means
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No it's not, it's gross
(Gets the people going!)

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Verse 4: Kanye]
You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin, actin’ like the summer ain’t mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home) You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me in my zone, don't let me in my zone
Don't let me in my zone, don't let me in my zone
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it, how you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me in my zone (I’m definitely in my zone)




[Cam'ron]
Let's do it (Forever)

[Intro]
And that I will
Yess, Gotta get 'em

[Verse 1]
Fee! Straight up gangsta, Hollygrove gangsta
Lay a nigga down in pink stuff
Them soft ass dudes just think tough
We shoot and put them shanks up
We tryin' live to summer and put them minks up
I'm sinked up in the coupe, the eyes chinked up
Pull up on a bitch at the light, that night linked up
Whole lotta shit in the life of a young boss
Bet that V.V.S. ice will bite your face off
Yeah, I ignite and take off, now catch up
I'm the best doing it, c'mon niggas 'fess up
Nigga feel different he could chess up and guess what
I bring it to his chest, to his right lung and left lung
Nigga get a check up, nigga put ya cheque up
I swear I'm on fire, need water like a hick-up
So I guess I might as well can say that
I'm the best today and (Forever)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, candy paint! T, I'm ridin' in the peppermint
Even my leather got leather trim
I'm on another element
I keep somethin' in the trunk like a elephant
Bet you remember it, like a elephant
I got this rap bottled up like medicine
Who's better than? Fuck him!
I probably fucked her, ah, what's new?
And if you hatin' on us, yeah, fuck you
And if them bitches wanna fuck us, we wanna fuck too
What a coincidence
And we cause accidents, not incidents
I am big shit, they're eensy-wens
They're not even a letter in my sentences
Sittin' in my coupe on 20-inch
So it's like I'm fencing bitch, I will stunt (Forever)
So stop being defensive bitch
I'm relentless bitch, I'm in this shit (Forever)
Now end this shit




[Beanie Sigel]
Yo I come from a crack in the ground, a hole in the wall
And dog when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
Or eat you from the inside and hollow you up
And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
And its sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced
A rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route
And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out
Really, tryin to weed it out
No the flipside we choosin your way
Like gettin fat from losin the weight
Or losing that from, usin the weight
I feel like I'm speeding and I'm 'bout to crash
No where to go and I'm gettin there fast

[Hook]
(girl singing)
Ooouu hooouu, got nowhere
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to
Ooouu hooouu, got nowhere
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to ruuuuunnnnnnn
(man speaking, girl singing throughout)
We in the streets player get your mail
There's only two places to go, we either dead or in jail
What the...
(girl singing)
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere

[Beanie Sigel]
Eh yo I'm caught up in the system where the blind lead the blind
And this artist only speaks on the signs of the time
And I pop pills in purple rain to state my pain
They say I'm just like my father, bold and too cold
But you know thats how a thug ride
I send a kite through a dove in a jail where the thugs cry
I feel your pain when you restrained and your love die
And make your heart hard, the blood in your vein fry
Feel like I'm trapped and I'm blindfolded
But my eyes wide open to see it
Feel like the O'Jay's, climbin those stairways hopin
Heaven's gates wide open for me
Look towards a lie, Sige in direction
Still I spin in every direction, seekin directions
Tryin to balance out the good with the imperfections
Yeah I know I still move with nowhere to go

[Hook]

[Freeway]
It seems like we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom to see faces of the people that I shot
When I get high late night, flow through the bottom
My aunt's house, one of the places that I stopped
See she just died, she got cancer from smokin and drinkin
The same shit that I'm drinkin and smokin
I can't lie, wish life would just open its handcuffs
And let me go, I feel like I'm doin a bit
I can't slide, so what I'm a rapper?
I can't escape the wrath of Allah
If I crash up my whip or get, blast in the jaw
Prick, mastered his fifth
I might go triple platinum, become a household name
After a long day of out of town work make my way to the plane
Plane fast in the tenth
Hear mayday, mayday, control's outta work
How the hell can life end like this? Nowhere to go

[Hook]




[Intro]
I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
You know what I'm saying
I'm saying I put my personality into it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out "money ain't a thing"
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
Calling you later saying what she crying about
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Why all the bogus hoes want to front on k
Why the fine hoes can't have one on the way
I prolly tell her to keep it, it'll be our little secret
Boniquan now my shorty looking fine: Puerto Rican
As long as she don't flip it tell her man that we creepin'
What we doin' is all day
When I hang up it ain't called hate its called wait
When you get popped don't call me call Clay
That's your man ain't it
That's the plan ain't it
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted

[Hook]
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
Shit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

[Verse 2]
Now these hoes run gun I ain't finna say nothing
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
Don't trip, this bitch was a whip
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
I'm thinking she was lying by the looks on her face
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Must've thought she was gon' make a fool out of me
To bail this nigga out all she need was a G
Now she must've came to me so I had to change the beat
I said look hoe you must be crazy off that dope
That's when I snatched the rope then I kicked her on the floor
And all that shit I bought you bitch I want it back
You lied to me return of the Mac

[Hook]
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

[Verse 3]
All y'all niggas is new with it
I paid my dues with it
Gave hoes abortion loot they bought shoes with it
Say they pregnant who's is it
Tell 'em you did it
Forcing these niggas out of abortion cheese
Paid a couple of hundred now or later more than G's
[?] have a kid by a lame ass broad
I knocked up this girl I barely liked cause she bugged me
She ain't even cute, our baby prolly by ugly
And I ain't happen to have that baby and your stomach doing [?]
How much it cost to get rid of it? I give you half of that
But I didn't know that she was on the pill
Needed the money for her hair and her nails
And her cell phone bill
Hoes'll get you its like getting robbed without a pistol
[?] come up on a nigga
[?] like you not the one cause she ain't got no proof
What happen nine months later when she was telling the truth

[Hook]
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
[Hook]
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
Shit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago




Snippet

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, new niggas, man
Uh

Niggas wanna play both sides
Like both sides got very fine people
One side is fightin' Klan and the Nazis
The other side is straight evil
If people wantin’ to be equal is a threat to you
And equality is death to you
You're probably insecure about your testicles
We celebrate diversity with carnivals and festivals
When you all about the dollar bill
That philosophy'll probably kill
Intolerance is puttin’ people in the hospitals
Politicians makin' sure that you don't pay your doctor bills
Bush seen out here talkin' 'bout he David Copperfield
Malcolm X, bloodstained shoes are a lot to fill
Liberals keep tellin' us these Nazis is not for real
Tell that to the woman that they killed down in Charlottesville
Yellin', "Blood and soil"
Sayin', "Jews will not replace us"
What will it take before you call ’em racist?
Domestic terrorist, you...




[Intro]
Nobody ever really loved loved loved loved
Me me me me me me me me…

[Verse 1]
She say she gotta do her nails and condition her hair
Find a pair of shoes and a fittin’ brasier
Slick shorty describe her description it’s fair
But say no other chick in this world can compare
And no other nigga got permission to stare
I say I never listen
Never mention I care
When they gone I never miss em
Never diss em a tear
Cause other women to fill that position is there
It’s the same game just a different affair
Different dame, different name, different distance from here
She say well things gon change
Now her mission is clear
Let her get off the phone and get off to homes
She knock on the door
It's business from there
Start strippin' her gear and switchin’ her rear
I'm not flinchin'
Cartier on my vision impaired
And enough ice
To condition the air
Now the boy got game and the girl got hurt
The boy got brains and the girl got worth
Cause the boy got fame
Do whatever he say
Now the boy get paged like every other day

[Refrain]
Nobody ever really loved me
It's just the birds and the bees
The her's and the he's
The his the ma’ams
The sirs and the she's
C’mon, c’mon
And u know this man
And if somebody ever loved me

[Verse 2]
She say she gotta get him dressed and hit him with rules
Feed ‘em breakfast and send ‘em to school
She say she need a rest her mind she finna lose
I tell her recline ke’ and just keep cool
She sick to her area her she fixin' to move
In physical fitness her own business
Can I get a witness, this chick is a jewel
And she tired of the things that I’m sendin’ her through
She say when I’m gon see you
And don’t say whenever, you
Know I won't leave you
But won't wait forever and
Got my own paper
And don’t take your cheddar
And no I'm not finished
I won't take the check
And I say chill you my winner from the door so
Step for set and dinner and a show
She say I be wearin' blue in the worst way
Don’t wear your chain, just the watch I bought for your birthday
Boy on the town and older woman down cause
Boy make her laugh when older woman sad
And older woman freak and he hold her ‘til she sleep
And he gotta send her flowers like every other week

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
She say she get off work at a quarter to nine
So don’t be late stop ignoring the time
Unless you got something more important in mind
Like wildin' wit them whores I’m filin' for divorce
I’ll see yo ass in court just send me child support she
Wanna get married and child wanna carry
My child, her smile, my ears in her belly
She even got Fias-wife typed in her cellie
She been there from the start she there from the heart
From the walk, to the bike, to the bus, to the cars
The flights and the kites the lonely lonely nights
From please leave on the lights when she was scared of the dark
And she got the pin if I ever hit the pen
I gotcha baby say I’ve got her crazy
Ever since that party at the Rex
I locked down her heart in cardiac arrest
Now the boy got a wifey and the wifey wanna ring
Cause she wanna be his wife
But the boy had it right
That you just ain’t ready
It's too early in your life
But whatever the weather that boy will have her ever

[Refrain]

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Kanye West]
Your house got another house?
My bitch got a bitch, my spouse got another spouse
Someone, humped on, kissed on another, ah
Hug her, gon' thugga, uh, huggin' when we hug it out
Bitch, I'ma...




[Intro: Kanye West]
Ayy, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Somebody
Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Woo! Told my wife I need a threesome
Woo! Be out all night until three somethin'
Woo! Yeezus Christ, I need three nuns
Woo! They gon' suck me off like a Capri-Sun
Haan? You see this coat? Mothafucka ask where I got the fleece from
Lookin' for the competition, I don't see none
They tell me be humble, tell 'em be somethin'
My two balls make her bust three nuts
Drink it out the bottle then I poured it on her D-cups (haan)
Ball so hard, went D1
Jumped over the Jumpman, just stumped the tree stump (woo)
Breakfast at the SOHO, give her FOMO like a mofo
Ooh, say she want gold, though what would she do for some logos?
Black girl want me for my Benz
White girl want me for my skin
Yeezy Season resurrected again
Who you with when it's me verse them, haan?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Somebody
Gotta be the bad guy
I had a bad day at work
Don't wanna have a bad night, ayy

[Refrain: Young Thug & Kanye West]
I ain't new to this shit, fuck-nigga
I'm trappin' from the other side
So get outta your seat, stand up (wooooo!)
Stand up

Please tell that lil' nigga man up (lil' nigga, stand up, woo)
Stand up (lil' nigga, stand up)
Stand up (hey, hey)
Hey, hey, stand up, stand up, stand up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
First of all, let me tell you somethin' (what?)
I don't give no fuck 'bout no niggas (woo)
I don't give no fuck, I'm not givin' two fucks (woah)
Roll up and pop one of these niggas (blat)
I do this shit for my woadies (woo)
You do this shit for your shorty, you bitch
Shut the fuck nigga, fresh out of the bottle
[?]
I'ma watch the nigga nose shatter like a picture
I'ma fuck his ho like [?] missile
I'ma keep a whole lotta lead for these pistols (what?)
And my money long like the nose on a [?]
But she a [?], she write, no pen
But you know I'm gon' suspend her

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I ain't new to this shit, fuck-nigga

[Verse 3: Tyga]
I might have to jump from the three-point line
I might take a piss on the Hollywood sign
She always bite her lips every time she lyin'
She bite her lips every time she say she mine (woo, sheesh)
Can't be my baby with no "Maybe"
I'm always more truthful when I'm angry
I can't go to dinner with my lady
This fame shit's crazy
Nigga got more whips than slavery
My shit in Barney's sellin' like it's Macy's
Been two months since I talked to Jay-Z, this fame shit's crazy




[Mase]
Let's get it on

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am

[Verse 1: Loon]
First of all, I was the worst of all
The first born, took my first breath, it was on
And thanks to my moms, and some help from Nicky Barnes
I was raised in ways of a Don
They gas me like Exxon
Had me dealin' with ex cons, frontin' with they Rolex on
Get sexed on a regular basis, grown women puttin' they faces
In all the wrong places, molesting me, now you see why my destiny
Was fucked up cuz my recipe
But I blame my mother cuz I can't blame no other
And that's how my game was discovered
My mom was a sucker, did that bullshit to my brother
But no matter what, I'mma love her
She gave me life, even though she got high undercover
If she die, I can't find me another
But look what you made me

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am

[Verse 2: Meeno]
Yeah, you made me this way, since the day I was born
When you slid on that crack shit, mom be strong
'Fore long, I realized the same old song
Another cat that done bounced on his kid and his spouse
At the beginning, I knew my pops just had to be kidding
He's coming back any day, he wouldn't leave us that way
But anyway, the time got longer, my anger got stronger
It's no time to wonder the money I hunger
Without a blunder, I vowed to be all I could be
Started running guns O.T., me and my code D
Leave from the backstreets of A-T-L to N-Y-C
When the gunspot got hot, I switched to the D
When the D spot got hot, I went low key
Now that Harlem World spot hot, and I'm on TV
I don't need no fake calls from yo' ass at all
Just leave me the way you left me and watch me ball

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am

[Bridge: Nas]
What, what, uh
You the reason
And I thank you, what
Check it out

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, yo, stormy night, September '73
Would you believe what my mom recieved from heaven was me?
Second from me, my younger brother desperate as me
We see the world alike, type of girls he likes, the girls I like
The shit that make him mad, it make me hype, bug like that
Share the same blood like that, grew up around thugs poppin' and shit
Cardboard boxes and shit, dirt bikes
But now we hoppin' whips and merc, right?
Money's my birthright, my righteous birth so I floss
It's up to you to look inside yourself, see what's yours
Consecutive times, New Year's Eve, light off nines in the skylines
Imaginary graves, poor the Henney on it
Share with my dogs who's here, cuz there's so many gone
Yeah, Meeno, Ill Will, all my people
Big Stretch, we'll never forget, Allah keeps you
Until we meet again, through my pen y'all can speak through, uh

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
You made me
You made me
You made me the way I am today
You're the reason why
I live how I live
Cuz you made me the way I am




[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Yes! Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Ladies...

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I got you in the mood, for an interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin
And rappin and fuckin', and passin' the dutch and relaxin'
And puffin' and hittin' and duckin', the rippin production
These kittens ain't muffins, just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words is drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady, but
One glimpse and I know they're ready, you already know
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

[Hook: Talib Kweli (Kanye West)]
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars (uh, uh)
Navigate through the truly bizarre (Yeezy, uh-uh)
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told you, oh
Lose, eat crews like crews like soul food
The only producer that feel like "fuck rappers!"
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say...
Is this a Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like
Just like, I'm the shit
Uh, you ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that "this ain't out yet," but this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggas plug like outlets
Far as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets, so, when I go out
Niggas always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow, I'm with my girl
And I'm tryin to hit the movies yo, and they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tootie
This girl got a silicon booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like 50, throw her in a pool, G!

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

[Interlude: Talib Kweli]
Break it down, uh!
What?
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Yeah!

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Donte and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bojangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club, doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

[Outro: Roy Ayers]
Wow, that's a nice track!




Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
You'll be born again in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
New walk, new talk, who that, who this?
Who else you know this bad with two kids?
Nobody nowhere, ever gave you this
Nobody flew to Colombia, like you did
Trying the new dress out with the new drip
Buying a new bag, first one to get
Nothing that you miss, it's on the to-do list
And I get in fluent all by the influence
Old sins don't count
Old friends might bounce
Told the devil, "Get behind me, I ain't ever going out"
Start, the leaders tryna doubt
But we never going out
My body's soul, who you think you dealing wit now?
This a new jig, got a party table at the Ruth Chris
All God's children take a group pic
Turn the flash off 'cause we too lit
You used to twerk to every-every song
You done partied every way, now you're very, very on
Spent it on a bottle like Christ on the phone
All glory be to God, Hallelujah, carry on

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
You'll be born again in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
New body, you ain't working hard
But I gave my life to you, you deserve it all
Now if he calls you, I ain't perfect
I know sometimes I agree, but it's worth it
Tryna put my legs up, never give up
Only thing I'm tryna do is give that sin up
Look at the scoreboard, I love to show off
And if anybody step to you, then they too wrong
'Cause every last one, go ahead, return it
And if the price ain't what you asked for, every sermon
That's why I'm turning to Your commandments
'Cause I know all you do is give me strength, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
You'll be born again in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's?
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Now I don't need no Robocop

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?
Somebody please make her stop

[Verse 3]
Stop ... drop ... roll ... pop
Bitch I'm cold ... I
Ain't used to being told ... stop
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow, you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know
Yeah I had her before but that happened before
You get mad when you know, so just don't ask me no more
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh
It ain't ok, ok, ok

[Outro]
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (You need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (You need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now




[Chorus]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love, and make history
Why won’t you visit me, until she visits me
I’ll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I've practiced so hard for this moment victory don’t leave
I know what this means, I’m stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, but the same old things
All I got is dreams, but nobody else could see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history

[Chorus]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
So now I’m flirting with death
Hustling like a G, while victory wasn’t watching
Took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne
Before I got proactive, I couldn’t face she
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly
A success is like lust, she's good for the touch
She's good for the moment, but she’s never enough
Everybody’s had her, she’s nothing like V
A success is all I got, unfortunately
But I’m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of V's
But something tells me that there’s much more to see
Before I get killed, cause I can’t get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together to make history

[Chorus]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now victory is mine, she tastes so sweet
She’s my trophy wife, she's coming with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He’s my legacy, son of my hard work
Future of my past, he’ll explain who I be
Rank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3
If I ain’t number one then I failed you victory
Ain’t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain’t in it for the money, can’t take it when you leave
I wanna be remembered long after you grieve
Long after I’m gone, long after I breathe
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
That's my last will testimony
This is much more than a song, it’s a baby shower
I’ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours




[Intro]
Change if you can do without the things I can't get you
Something  I been countin'-
When's  enough enough bae?
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn
When's  enough enough bae?
Shit,  I feel like

[Bridge]
Feel like De Nero on Casino
Where  they got the sun up for the C-note
Rings and cash for you to burn
Know I'm shining when you growin' on the ice
The kind of stuff you earn
What  you expect? Me and the girl, she was blowin' on the dice
Run the game, thirty game for the-
Rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn

[Verse]
You can follow some, [?]
[?] you to learn, that you will learn
You can [?] find [?]
[?] you to learn, the nights you done learned
You can take my [?] love [?]
Wave 'em down [?] cash for you to burn
You can take my phone away [?] lock [?]
I'm gon' [?] 'less you gon' learn, 'less you done learned
You can take the [?] up out, fold up, grind back on 'em
[?] you done learned, cash you done burned
You can say what you want, you been lyin'
Know you had 'em [?] you done learned, cash you done burned

[Outro]
Rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn
Rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn




[Verse 1: Big Boy]
One thing that makes me mad is when people get foolish
On Halloween, people start to feel like they're kinda ghoulish
Comin' into my face, sayin' "Hey can I get a picture?
Can I get a picture of you and your son?" and I say "Hold on, I don't want one"
Step back, get away, give me my space
Wait, give me my space, because I may Chris Brown you and punch you dead in your motherfuckin' face
Because I don't like people comin' into my category, into my area
Because they cause mass hysteria
It gets scarier, or should I say it's scary
Because I can hit high notes, kick in your nuts like Mariah Carey
And that's the way it is, so those things make me mad
When my momma passed away, that was the thing that made Big Boy really sad
We're talkin' about mad, we're talkin' 'bout gettin' frustrated
We're talkin' about before me and my girl got married, before we dated
We're talkin' about when people say things about my momma or my family
You can't do that to me, because you can't trust me
Now I'm Ida's son, Keith's brother, Sheila's brother, Kenny's brother
Sharell's brother, Nicole's brother, Sharnice's brother, a whole lot of brothers
But anyway, let me get back on topic
That's the way it is when I kick freestyles, let me stop it
So Kanye, you're here
What makes you mad? Make it clear
I'm fallin' off, let me put my shoes back on, let me tie 'em up
Kanye, here you go, brother, could you please fill up our cup?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you're gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like the next Sinatra to 'em
Uh, ayo I got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Ayo, before I lose it, and have to prove it
This the way that we gon' do it, time we gotta move it to the future
Kamasutra
Any way that suit yah
Don't shoot yah
Stop the violence and it's been stopped
Uh, we stopped the violence in the hip-hop
Uh, we stopped the hatin' and the degredation
Uh, we 'bout to build like one nation
Uh, got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn, like Ice Cube said
Uh, I'm the rudest
Lot of people say that, cause they say Ye don't play that
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye juice
Uh, that's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
Uh, my crib spacial
Uh, my relationship is interracial

[Verse 3: Big Boy]
You can't categorize me, you can't put me in a box
I'm the ox that rocks, bagels and locks
Learn what you're eatin', learn the menu
Cause I continue to send freestyles through your denu
Or should I say I dim you, down like a lightswitch
That's the way it is, Big Boy, you know I'm not a yitch
I gotta go 'head and censor myself
And if you look into my pocket, I'm a little bit of wealth
But anyway, Ida's son, the real McCoy
Ida's son, the homies, they call me Big Boy
Yesterday, today, [?]
I had to drop 7-10 cause it's Kanye West day
In the neighborhood, Power 106, it's all good
That's the way it is, I think you should
Let me get back on, because I'm fallin' off again
Let me kick my volume way past 10
'Because it's Ida's son, the B-I-G
Big Boy's in the house, in the place to be
I don't know why I'm saying these old simple last rhymes
But anyway, I'm Kickin back with some friends of mine
That's louis, E-man, and Kanye, Can't Forget Ricky
That's the man that's on the microphone
[?]
Thats the man thats on the turntables, Willing and able

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I don't where to start, I don't where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the, Maybe the flow
Maybe the ’Go, where i was grow
Where I grew up in, Where you could see
When my momma divorced my daddy and we moved down [?]
When we was three, in the cold
Straight from Chicago, where I go
And everybody know
From my homie Don C, I be eh
Ay yo, like IBM
Or Apple Steve Jobs, or this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Ay yo its very very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel
I can do it in every tempo, I use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build Churches
That could be as big as the Adams Family, where it lurches
Ay yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed motherfucker
Ay yo, it ain't no
No cursing in the versing, what you know is not perfect
And you know its still worth it
I might short circuit
I might just blackout
Hit you with that blakka, you know I'm the rocker
Number one Chief rocker, Number one Chief rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop em', ain't nobody gon' stop us because
I got God on my side, thats the way I ride
Jesus  Christ
Yeezus Christ
Yeezus nice




[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow homey...
Drive slow homey...
You never know homey might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Marty used to stay, Sunny 9th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked the leases, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore girls, go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lakers and our Royals, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but Dawg
Fuck all that flirtin' I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homey
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homey

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow homey...
Drive slow
You never know homey, about these hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do; I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'llac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin, you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do

[Kanye West]
Drive slow homey...

[GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes

[Kanye West]
Drive slow homey...

[GLC]
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go

[Kanye West]
Drive slow homey...

[GLC]
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know...

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You never know homey, might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got mo' TV's in here than where I live

[Verse 4: GLC]
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flickin' and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, "Just a Little' Bit"
Just a lil' bit
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homey drive slow...

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow homey...
Drive slow homey...
You never know homey, might meet some hoes homey
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Drive slow homey




(Verse 1) Freeway
You better call your local authorities
Switch phones if ya jack not working

Say they system got a short and they mics stop working

Tell ya peeps wear skates to ya funeral

And you sitting in the crib like what went wrong

Stuck for yo banco and props
Well I come dressing
To teach these little fellas a lesson
Got the to-tool hid in the bathroom of the delicatessen
I stop him from breathing
Drop his body
While the Spreewells rotating
Niggas hating on how I move my karachie
I catch people open like Carlito
Through the peep hole
So fresh I got him stabbing hisself in the chest like Peoples
You can't fuck wit my flow
Sip on my Moe
Smoke on my dro
And you can't stop a LB show
I spit G rhymes
While you fakers get the vapors
Chants like Jimmy Two Times
I get the papers get the papers
Can't fade us
Match us
Back us
Too good in the kitchen

I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you
Up in the mornin', miss you bad
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had
All this time, all he had, all he had
And what he dreamed, all his cash
Market crashed, hurt him bad
People get divorced for that
Dropped some stacks, pops is good
Mama passed in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Drivin' fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm comin' back
I'll be takin' all the stacks, oh

If I don't turn to you
No other help I know, I stretch my hands




[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Anything for my baby, I'd do some crazy things (Yeah)
So whatever he want, he can get that
Long as I like, we can hit that, hoes, we don't love 'em, no
Soon as we done she leavin' right out the door
If you can keep our freaky secret on the down low
We can have a special thing going on, whoa

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Threeway, I couldn't wait to have with you
'Cause I know what turn you on, so let's do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one

'Cause I know what turn you on, I had to do it, babe
'Cause two heads are better than one (One, one)

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
I'ma take off my skirt
Then she gon' touch me right there
Then it's gon' be your turn
So, baby, don't you be scared

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Threeway, I couldn't wait to have with you
'Cause I know what turn you on, I had to do it, babe

'Cause two heads are better than one

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ooh, three ways, her on top of me

'Cause two heads are better than one




[Hook]
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
Much more, much more than this
I did it my way...

[Verse 1]
It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got 'Ye, but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up at Baseline recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke, now I'm good, bitch
I ain't no Kennedy, but I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beaten, but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though, we needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
Niggas wanna diss K on their local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get they hair cut in the Little Shop of Rumors
You lil' sloppy with your cockiness ain't ya?
A little arrogant with all your comparisons
Cause as far as the Chi, I got the most plaques
Since the beginnin' of rap and nah, y'all ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough, how I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin', shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though?
Why? Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Awww, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nawww, he's got titties under his shirt

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, fuck that, dog, I get my own way
Niggas ain't believe me, 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay four stars or better
Cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off layaway at Marshall's
Polo and Carbesher's, we into them things dawg
Back in '96, we was livin' like kings dawg
40 cal.s or better, tottin' them things dawg
So up the Turkish snake, and take them rings off

[Hook]




[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Aye...B, C, D, E, F
We picking up right where we left...
Off, and I took a recess
When I get back you gon' take that...
Off, in the mirror like hey me, stay me
I make money, money don’t make me
Hey honey, what do you take me...
For, don’t look at me like I’m crazy
Don’t ever think that'd phase me
You ain’t finna do nothing, you ain’t crazy
You ain’t built like, that
Hey baby what it feel like, ahhh
Just forget I said it, screw it
It don’t really matter what you do when you do it
Tony Williams in this bitch, who you is

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 2: Tony Williams]
You can go, you can come
You can walk, you can run
Do whatever you want: just have fun
Dictatorship's not for human people
What good is love if we can't be equal
What good if light if it does not shine?
Go on and get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
How do you get old if you never been new?
I'm telling you the truth baby!

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Here’s another day in the life
Of a champion knight
Do I still have some fight
I’m ashamed but I might
Whether wrong, whether right
I see danger in sight
Are we going in?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I’m feeling like Stevie right now, you know…
I had the strangest feeling lately
The nigga's so fake I'm off it
And every time they flake like frosted
I just make my profit
And get a girl who barely bra fit
Aw shit! He back on his feet like carpet
He was just playing possum
Playing like I wasn't awesome?
Yeah I got some jokes, don't I?
Ha ha ha, laugh it up
And they'll be wack
And we'll be the last ones cracking up
Matter fact, because you nigga wanna doubt me?
Let's see how it feel without me
Taking off on this rocket, Yao Ming

[Chorus: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you




[Produced By Anthony Kilhoffer, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know)
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Picture, if you will, that the throne's burning
Rome's burning, and I’m sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don’t determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I’m sorry, but I just can’t die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I’ll be fly when Easter’s over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told, after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know)
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces 'fore you swept on it
Goddamn, this shit leaves a mess, don’t it?
Shit feelin’ like death, don’t it?
Charge it to the game, whatever’s left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly, pelican, fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasn’t I a good king?
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?
Didn’t I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
Huh, I gave you my loyalty
Made you royalty and royalties
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees
And this is how niggas rewarded me, damn

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
(Ooooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Bussin’ at me, b-b-b-bussin’ at me
But I’m bulletproof, bitch, you can’t get nothin’ past me
Got body armor
A nigga gotta watch the throne
And I’m bussin’ back
So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turns to hate?
Gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes
Caesar didn’t see it so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brother’s keeper?
Only if that nigga don’t creep up
Got a pistol under my pillow
I’ve never been a deep sleeper
P-p-p-paranoia, 'cause the nigga that said he’ll
Blast for ya is now blastin' for ya
That’s an assassin for ya
These niggas got a shot, they’ll shoot
Please Lord, forgive him
For these niggas not know what they do, ooh




[Verse 1: Pusha T]
It's like watching my whole life flash in front of me
Knowing I am one of the
Best whoever done it, as a writer shuns it
Them niggas young MC, while I Big Pun it
Trying to revisit that impact when Big done it
Or when Pac did it, even when Nas won it
I Daddy Kane over the tracks, them niggas King Sun it
I'm from the era when BET had team summit
Now the watch is like a hell date to turn my stomach
This high level of artistry's a part of me
I'm bored by so called peers, y'all have to pardon me
Graffiti beat street, write my life for all to see
You take a bite and leave the rest I remind you of Lee
Do your history, if you can't reminisce with me
You connect the parallels and recognize what gift it be
It's not a mystery, no more second guessing him
At this point you ain't got to question who I'm better than

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Food on the table, when it's not
I move that lean, keep them fiends up and down the block
It's my routine, seventeen, though the block is hot
I'm coming cool with my tool, knocking of my rocks
Long story short, I done made it through some shit
That has got lots of niggas laid in view
What I say to dudes, wake up from that snooze
Before that nigga dead on the news in the View
I done slept in cribs with grenades, crazy weapons
Pushed cars with more drugs than Rite Aid and EPIC
Across state lines, without my squad
Just to get paid, laid it all on the line
Now I thank God, there ain't nothing else
That kept a nigga free or turn him back into dust
You know how many niggas I done buried
Niggas ask for cheddar too
Wishing they were free on the bricks to make a better move
Pull some four hundred months, some got forever
Trade everything you treasure for some nice weather
Or some good pussy, a kiss from a whore, a trip to the store
Wake up young boy

[Chorus: Kanye West & Elton John]
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

[Verse 3: Sandman]
It's complicated this life I live
The cars, the whores are beautiful but I all need is focus
Cut the ladder up, the ladder to success that I climb
I steer steps to the top, I'm complex
I'm a hustler with a turbulent mind
Modern day thinking, statues to interpret the lines
The well thought out, when I was caught out
There when I was tortured
Seems to morph with my inner thoughts, it's torture I bear
Like a mob, when I was robbed of my youth
The dope game pulled a nigga feet first
In the flames with cocaine
What a wonderful bitch I made
Man that nigga can't front I love them acolaydes
The dope money from the out lookin in they see a thug nigga thing
So unconsciously I'm draped in drug dealer bling
Drug dealer street can't get his crown now
We got it 4 cheap volume 3, nigga bow down

[Verse 4: Malice]
Only does it seem that the grass is greener
Never would have dreamed cash come between us
So hysterically I laughed
I thought it was understood I give you my last
I thought it was to the good, baby boy could rap
We long since left the hood, the rest should be a snap
Or so I thought, instead it was a slap to the face
To this day, what am I to make of that
If I could the old days I'd wish them back
When the OJ's played and the crib was still intact
Forever mine, quickly turned to never mine
I pondered to myself, if I had never signed
And in my mind, I was only trying for better
The Big Wheel era should have lasted forever
Who knew we lacked glue to stick together
I find it so hard to keep my head up

[Chorus: Kanye West & Elton John]
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning




It's Kanye West straight outta Chi-Town
Super producer brought you joints like
H to the Izzo, Takeover and that new Scarface single
And I'm chillin with the leader of the new school
Absolute heavy hitters y'all

[Intro]
Yo...
I'm Kanye To The, first of all coming straight from the Chi
Uh, I don't lie
It's like the singer say
I've been known to do beats like that, know what I'm saying
Brought you hits such as
Uh, Uh
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Gimme some brain before I hop up on this plane
Gotta head right back to the Chi

[Verse 1]
Now even though I went to college and dropped outta school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time only
Two way or phone me, if you tryna bone me
Yo man got money, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinneded Nia, dark skinneded Tamia
Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out that's why I barely hear ya
It be going in and out like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like Rob and G-Dep
And I'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it gets so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still

[Hook]
K-A-N-Y-E, Chi-Town playa out in NYC
She said she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans cuz the ass is free

[Verse 2]
I love girls, girls, I got a fetish for em
But not no lettuce for em
Dick and bad credit for em
Bills, bills, I know she tryna get paid
She know I'm tryna get laid
She figure that's an even trade off
If she a stewardess I show her to my cockpit
If she a lawyer then I give her Johnnie Cochran
If she wanna see me again
She better get 2 friends then maybe then
We'll have group sex, toothex
And a young girl off that X
And she just turned eight-teen
Last week she was against the law
So for her birthday I put this dick against her jaw
And like a picture in a frame put it against the wall
Said she had never been with a man before
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
I didn't know y'all take each other out and date each other
But that's a lady lover
I ain't even know that was ya baby mother

[Hook]

[Outro]
Explain the outro man, don't nobody never get to the outro
I just take a whole record and just
I'm not gonna talk about the producer shit right now
I just want niggas to realize my shit, you know what I'm saying
2002, aight
I sounded real mad on the last mixtape
I'm not even gonna go there this time, ok

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say:
"We don't care what people say"

[Kanye's cousin Kim]
"Hey Kanye, this is your cousin Kim
I just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this CD, it's hot!
Especially that song “Drug Dealer”
You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years
I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage
You talkin' 'bout people paying shine on $6.55 an hour;
People can't pay their rent for $6.55 an hour
So, it just... It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
You know, and people are human
They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do
The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax
A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in
The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in
So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)
So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;
You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job
So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know
Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...
That they try to bring their kids to school...
That they try to make a difference."

[Answering Machine]

[Hook: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Hook: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Post-Hook: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
Sky, sky high! I’m, I’m sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!




So many people get caught up in trying to remake their first album and it's impossible for me to make another College Dropout, but I could make the best Graduation and best 808's that I could make. And that's how you, I think, keep advancing as an artist. So few, you know, Hip Hop artists have ever advanced: their songs on their seventh, eight album sound exactly like the songs of their first album. More than a artist, I'm a real person and real people grow and I wanna just sing my growth

[Hook]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my lights
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
But how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Verse 1]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door..
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know
That you know

[Bridge]
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you and I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Bridge 2x]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

That you know, ohhh

In my soul
Gonna take you to the glory
Goal, in my mind I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my

Now where the West Side
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog, are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton, bitch
I think Hennessy, I drink, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona. I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And hey, please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, rock a chain 'steada wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy
I did it for the glory

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir (with backing vocals from John Legend]
Yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
The glory

I did it for the glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
The glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G
Any one: Big Pun, Big L or Notorious
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Yeah I'mma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir (with backing vocals from John Legend]
Yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
The glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
Now where the South Side
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
Now where the West Side

I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my




[Hook: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
See my life was kinda simple like Nicole and Paris
'Til i started making dollars like I rolled with Paris
Then we went our seperate ways like annulling a marriage
Cause they talk behind my back even worse than the past
Cause while i tried to make it happen they preferred an excuse
And that rubbed me the wrong way like a pervert masseuse
Cause nothing free about juice when you go to the market
So how you using mine just to corner the market
Now I'm more of a target than the items in Target
And matter fact homie I'm tired of talkin'
So if you got them killers what you need to do is send one
Otherwise start calling me Ben cause i been one
Cause 'Quence getting stung ain't in this package deal
So I'm screening all my calls like the actors deal
And since [?] in the hood is even higher than Dre Day
I could give a damn about the things that they say

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of "classic" is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

You can't buy this Superfly-ness, like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh, you went platinum? Yeah, that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got Criminal Minded?
You, you, you; y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why? I don't need 'em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? C'mon, where you at?
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?




[Chorus: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't have all the hood rats and mud rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mom a crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah field

[Chorus: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't




[Hook: John Legend]
We can't even sit and talk, without you arguing
You're the one who started it

[Verse 1]
I got a girl at home but she don't cook
I have my condoms in the stove cause she won't look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure its safe to pull a grocery ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor isle
She said "I hope its not too ghetto"
Rocked all gold force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin wild
Like last week I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, 16
Now the car only 1 years old, oh
Man but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case I better take my ass home
Where the problems is, arguments be Daly like Carson is
But the problem is..

[Hook]
We can't even sit and talk no more, without you arguing
Girl you must be out of your mind, no no no
You're the one who started it

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a second man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second hand
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses 'bout my Porsches
Condos in front of the golf courses
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake Roley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way the censorship'll go off, you know me
I ain't call you, you wanna know why?
Im in Noha, Hon aloha, pushin jet skis so I
Couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun? Stays down there
What's happenin here? Made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat, why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
But the problem is..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man, boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after 2 or 3 or 4
I ain't messin with them girls no more
It's weak, the benz coupe is so sweet
When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, "You must love that car more than me
And nigga I was with you before the cheese
So you need to work on your pri-or-ities
If she went with Fabolous I bet that she would be
A-R-G-U-I-N-G and please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm getting spins on
W-K-R-P in Cincinnati
You think I'd get my voice so deep like
W-K-R-P in Cincinnati
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this?

[Hook]




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yap, yap, yap
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, fuck you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Nigga behave

[Verse 1: Price]
Uh, look, I can't behave (No)
We can't behave, us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave (Yeah), got treated like slaves
Young niggas been treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This what I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, "Bitch, get back in the door" (Get back in)
I've been comin' up and up and down, I can't take no more
Kamikazes are commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, they ain't fittin' (Nah-ah)
Poppin' pistols, droppin' writtens (Uh-huh)
Poppin' penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it (Yeah)
My, my, my, my, look at little Scotty now (Now)
The same fuckers used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud
Can't wait to pull my zipper down, whip it out and

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Price]
Piss in your grave (Yeah), piss in your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade (Huh), in the third grade
This one right here for the kids at the grade (Ow)
In the third grave
How come you want it? Can't fuck with the bitch
This one ain't fair, this one for family
This one the damn, this one I thank
That's when thought it was safe and it wasn't
Pointer me, Allah, some on your water
I'm callin' your mada, call on the collar




[Intro/Monologue]
When people come at me a certain type of way, uh, I forget them for
They base their opinions merely on what they were taught
You know, what they were given, what their parents taught them
You hear that? When you see this ain't, that- that's not nothing
They will never be anything and you know, I'm a pretty good dartboard 'cause I can take it
I'm a easy target, 'cause I don't fit in
I think through the gate, you know
From The College Dropout when I was the only person with a polo in the midst of a whole bunch of jerseys
That I was the, the difference
And I realized that I'm not just fighting a battle just for myself, but for a generation
You know, a generation fighting against the false information of the media
And the perceptions that people create in the matrix that society creates in the lies that people tell, and the-
And the laughs and the jokes that people tell all the way back in a high school lunch room
All the way to when you know, you're older, and anyone that decides to walk their own path as ostracize
And um, you know, you have to be stronger in that situation and that's- that's one of my main goals that they don't kill me can only can only make me stronger

[Verse 1]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Is this what you've been waiting for?!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
Uh, baby, you're makin' it

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
Is this what you've been waiting for?!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–
(I need you right now!)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin' now I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Chorus]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie

Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshield
It's still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm so happy I'm with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is, "Where my presents?"
She said, "Shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, "It's Dee-ricious"
Hahahaha, yeah

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]

[Verse 4: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I'm over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York, I'm still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Pusha T]
Christmas in Harlem

The mistletoe's right here (Check it, uh, uh)
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
On the stoop of that Brownstone, shovellin' the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Downtown got me feelin' like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feelin' like its down home
Snow like sugar hill, chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment, where's your NoDoz pills?
I caught her lookin' at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel, hope you know those real
Okay, my white girl Veronica, black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rockin' dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem

[Verse 7: Cam'ron]
Uh, Lenox Ave to Saint Nick, never seen Saint Nick (Nah)
Just niggas sellin' the same nicks, the same bricks (What up, y'all?)
Same hustlers running' up to Broadway
That's where the snow's at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo's (Jimbo's)
Christmas lights in project windows (Yes)
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)

[Verse 8: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let's have Christmas in the hood

[Verse 9: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
'Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls

[Chorus: sample & (Common)]
Faithful to the end (we got to be)
Faithful to the end (I want to be)
Faithful to the end (yes, it's for the people)
I'd like to be her very best friend
(God moves, yeah)

[Verse 1: Common]
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

[Chorus: sample]
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 2: Common]
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?"
He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"
"I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together"
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"Baby you a blessin' and my best friend"

[Chorus: sample]
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

[Outro: Bilal & John Legend]
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
So, so, so
So, so, so
So faithful
So, so, so
So, so, so
That's what I'm gonna do
Faithful to the end
That's what I'm gonna do
Faithful to the end
That's what I'm gonna do
Faithful to the end
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah




All I know is if the Grammys want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We ain't gonna play with them no more. 'Flawless,' Beyoncé video. Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyoncé, and at this point, we tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration and we as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. "Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody's speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, my daughter and my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity. That's the reason why I didn't say anything tonight. But you all know what it meant when 'Ye walks on the stage.

Not right now
Everything I write now
I don't even write down
I don't need her right now
But I'm so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard I'll be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the "B" got me body
There fees in the party?
Chillin' in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened, yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow
Just seen a nigga get Rob like Whoa!
Oh, should have tucked your chain
Niggas ain't playing man, it ain't a fuckin' game
All that frontin' for the audience
Make 'em not exist no more, Yugoslavians

(Yo
They try to jack my practice
Fully grown, fully blown, style's infectious
Why's it always VERBAL? The fact is
I'm in your face for ten years and still that fresh kid
Encrusted with stone colors never seen
Haters hate the accolades I get and underestimate
But wait, they still salivate
Looking at the chains I make
And they start calculating
Rumors start circulating
There's no relating
Y'all should be left out
This is my house, you don't like it?
Get the _______
So what now? Why you want to get with me?
Cuz I'm leaving legacies? 怒るでしかし!
全然デリカシー 無いとDANGER!
その頭はFAKE like it's アートの姉ちゃん
I'm that futuristic youth from Asia
If you can't comprehend then it's euthanasia)

[Verse 5: Big Sean]
Hit the stage see the floor all the seats obsolete
We gonna probably need more
And I don't walk around with an ID
Hit the club watch them line up like IV?
And hop up on that motherfuckin' carpet like HI-G?
I'm trying to get paid so I feel like a Cosby! Ching-Ching
Ooh yeah, Teriyaki Boyz, Big Sean we here
So make sure that camera's recording
I'm so important outfits imported
And your girl said "He's so ignorant"
So why the hell she can't ignore it
Dog, cause I'm everything you couldn't be
Everything you would be and everything I should be

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, and we G.O.O.D
Keep talkin' about this shit but whatever
We can go back and forth all day

[Chorus: Kanye West + Travis Scott (Ambrosia)]
(How much I feel, I live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love

Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
That's that don't play! Whuh! That's that new Ye
People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whuh!
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches
That's a fresh house, is that a guest house?
Your house got another house?
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We 'bout to tear this whole place up, pretty much
(How much I live)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
And you know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, babe
You know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, but me

[Chorus: Kanye West + Travis Scott]
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Hoe, we done made it through hell and disaster
My crib done got bigger, my women got badder
You wonderin', "How do you get in the game?"
I'm wonderin', "How do I get to the rafters?"
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
'Til I'm MJ or Magic, ooh, and she just want the status
So, you the man she got, but I'm the man that she been after
She done sent so many naked pics, my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina (Gina!)
I'm the good with the evil; fuck you, nice to meet you
You can't have a peace sign, man, without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree, they're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off with even diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it; scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesars
Piece of pizza with Tanisha now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
I got your dream girl, yeah, she actin' like a hoe at that
Throw her to me, I'ma throw that back
Top spot, I'm finna go at that (Straight up)

[Chorus: Kanye West + Travis Scott (Ambrosia)]
(I live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hoe, you gotta move quick
World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Hoe, and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top five list
I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list
Til everything I spit is all timeless
My girl on that all fine list
My life a little luck, a lot of grind, bitch!
No "maybe," hoe, I gotta make it
Fuck your nomination; man, fuck the world
I'm repopulatin', wrap my Rollie round my waist
Yeah, time's a-wastin'
Niggas want the comma-comma-combination
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot-dot-dot, a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain
Plottin' world domination, people ask me how to make it
I'm just like "man, if you want the crown, bitch, you gotta take it"
Straight up (Straight up!)

[Verse 1]
Whose house? Hov, no doubt
'Bout the only rapper still getting money in the drought
I moves out, in the global, I'm a mogul
Fifty thousand feet in the air and I'm still on my mobile
Fuck talking 'bout the recession, the shit's depressing
I rock with Obama but I ain't no politician
And I chill with the thugs and the gangsters too
I ain't a blood but I'm warring with the boys in blue
Crooked officer, crooked officer!
Why you wanna see me in a coffin, sir?
Is it against the law, the way I'm flossin', sir?
Benzes, Rolls Royces, and Porsches, ugh!
Haters like, "Hov, why you still talkin money shit?"
... 'Cause I like money, bitch!
I like fly shit, you like gossip
I let you do you! Why you riding my tip?

[Verse 2]
That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar
Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fucking rockstar
To-day is gonna be the day
That I'm gonna throw it back to you!
I'm living life as a rocker, I'm like Pimp C, partna
Coming down in Mercedes, peeling off on the boppers
Worldwide show, I'm coming down in a chopper
Hundred eighty thou', screamin "Hov!" with the Roc up
It's too easy!
I got ladies on shoulders, showing me they chi-chis
I met honey at the show last year
And now I'm acting brand new like a world premiere (world premiere!)
Yeah, I know life ain't fair
But chill, baby girl, my girl is here
I got models in the mosh pit
Dancing off-beat, but they know the words to my shit!

[Hook]
I seen you jockin' Jay-Z, jockin' Jay-Z, jockin'-jockin' (yeah!)

Jockin'-j-jockin'-jockin' (I'm so dope boy fresh!)

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta jock Jay-Z, jock fly shit
You ain't gotta jock me, homie; jock my chick
Jock her Zanottis; she body you with the fit
No, that's not Pilates; her body's just thick
You ain't gotta jock her, nigga; jock my clique
Jock the dope boys 'cause we all tossed bricks
Federales jock me while I'm crossing the bridge
Click, click! Take a portrait of this
I ain't no pretty boy; I got a gorgeous wrist
Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty... sick
I'm so ghetto chic
I'm where the hood and high fashion meet
Ooh-wee, I'm like the camouflauge Louis
How you niggas want it? The tux or the toolie?
Haters, I ain't mad at you
If I wasn't me I'd probably jock me too! (too!)

[Hook]
I seen you jockin' Jay-Z, jockin' Jay-Z, jockin'-jockin' (yeah!)
Jockin' Jay-Z, jockin' Jay-Z, jockin'-jockin' (yeah, y-y-yeah!)

[Young Jeezy]
Yeah
So what you gon' do? (TNG ain't nothin')
When they see TNG doin' it (Gettin' low) (Strapped up in this ma-fucka!)
You understand me?
Ha (You know what it is)
Better get low, nigga!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I'm just chillin' in that Phantom bumpin' that Yo Gotti
He's the boss of the town, call him young John Gotti
Sittin' down with the plug, 'bout to order up some tacos
Talkin' velveeta hella chips, nachos
And you really gettin' money, say cheese in this ma-fucka
Bitches on your dog like fleas in this ma-fucka
So many chains might freeze in this ma-fucka
Walked past a bitch like breeze in this ma-fucka
Black and gold stones, Drew Brees in this ma-fucka
Don't make me start talking quarter keys in this ma-fucka
Shell cases, night vision, ain't nothing stupider
Clips filled up, outta space (space), Jupiter
Don't make me start it up like a new Kawasaki
Drop me, hit ya in ya face, you'll be chicken teriyaki
While I'm on that new thug passion, that Belvedere and Saki
Chopping bricks with some chop sticks (chop sticks), I told you I got this

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem?
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)

You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem?
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm who they be, Chronic by the P, living comfortably
Come with me, round and some would see why they fuck with me
Bentley's pulling up in three, multi-colored fleet
Y'all sour me, my summer's sweet, kiss my mother feet
Hate just makes chop 'em as they creek, life forever sweet
Life's a gamble and I play for keeps in these streets, uh
Magnificant flow or magnifique, Rookie have a seat
Them lil nigga just my parakeets, smacking masterpiece
My life is good, my bitches bad
I'm switching pads, changing watches in my christmas bag
I got the gift of gab, talked my way in and took some ass
Whips and cash, come through half stepping and then get whipped in half
Southside's my heart, too hard to forget the past
Lost too many niggas to the dirt, keep the liquor stashed
My flows off the ropes, uppercuts, stick to jabs
Shorty wanna grab, catch a couple nuts, hit the cab

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an altoid case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’ma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh, bitch, I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest, bitch
She said “Hey ‘Ye”
I said “Yes, biiiiitch”
"Damn, I’m only asking you a question"
I met this milf at the allstar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular, you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us, that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie I’m pyjama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free”, I said "WOWZERS!"

[Hook]

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Ninja (ninja), Kawasaki (Kawasaki), Ducati (Ducati), my old Harley (my old Harley)
Rock the party, (rock the party)
Move your body, (move your body)

[Ryan Leslie]
Lets get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah

[Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait
Where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, ten to 8, Interstate 95, passenger
Baddest bitch in the state, half Spanish half Trinidad
Complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning 'round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes, so who gives a shit

[Hook]

[Swizz Beatz]
Wait a minute... (echos)




[HOOK: (Consequence)]
(You got to...) Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long man, we back in town

[Consequence]
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you "Bye"
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy, he got something to say

[Kanye West]
Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on "The Champions" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats

[Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiyyo I take you out
Either with the nine, or the Tec's in his mouth
And if that dime getting friendly then the orgy's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine, so you couldn't relate

[HOOK: (Consequence)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Yo, 'Quence?)
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down

[Consequence]
'Quence was out the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You staring at my rose-gold way too long
But I ain't scared to ride, that's why I wear Teflon
I took her on the ave' and she expect me to trip
But I made her window shop while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy

[Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say, "He don't look like a thug or a hood"
"But he keep them gorillas, so he still be good"
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out in N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm saying I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

[Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks

[Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and then call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

[Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and the Puffs from L.B
They know that Consequence be wearing gold and ice
Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Eh shorty, let me tell you 'bout the rules of my nights
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice

[HOOK: {Consequence} (Kanye West)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Kon Man Produc'!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (yeah! yeah!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (It's the ROC!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Aw, damn, Kon Man, we back in town (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down




[Verse]
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say

We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke
We all fish, better teach your folk
Give him money to eat, the next week he's broke

Yup, that's what you promised me, since the Bomber League
Along with, if we stay strong
We can get paper longer than Pippen's arms (woo!)
Plead the fifth when it comes to the fam
I'm like a dog: I never speak, but I understand
Where my dogs at? Where my soldiers at war?
Where your balls at? Whoa, gotta pause that, whoa
Lost 92 bricks, had to fall back
Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back
Had A-1 credit, got more crack
From the first to the fifth, gave it all back
If I'm not a hustler, what you call that?
This is before rap, this is all fact; I never change

Well, fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari
Was so young my big sis' still playin' with Barbie
Young brother, big city, eight million stories
Old heads taught me, youngin, walk softly
Carry a big clip, that'll get niggas off me
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy
Chains is cool to cop but more important is lawyer fees
(Uhh) That's how it is now, (uhh) that's how it always be
(Uhh) I never change, this is always me
From the womb to the tomb, from now until my doom
Drink Army from one cup, pass it around the room (that's a family nigga)
That's the ritual (yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool
And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
This is crew love, move music or move drugs
Rival crews, get your black suits up; I'll never change

[Chorus: Kanye West, sample & (JAY-Z)]
Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime 'cause crime pays (come on)

She love my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me"
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg?
Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 4: Beyoncé]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woo
(Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh)




Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Little lights all in one night, star
One night star, no lights ever [?] this far
One night star, they say the stars don't shine this far
One night star, they say the shine don't suns this far
This far down, this far down
Little light for one night, ah
One [?], they say the stars don't shine this far
This far down

[Verse]
Night lay me down with another clown
Over summer now, silver's not the summer now
[?] cutie, nights on a duty
The sun visits man, family on the [?] next morning
Added shows, no remorse
With his daughter, oh, be ashamed
Percocet [?] be the game
Little nose for the cold one
Later that night, he was feeling pour a hole on one

[Chorus]
Little lights all in one night, star
One night star, no lights ever [?] this far
One night star, they say the stars don't shine this far
One night star, they say the shine don't suns this far
This far down, this far down
Little light for one night, ah
One [?], they say the stars don't shine this far
This far down




Momma raised me up in Brum
I tasted the haste, it tasted like race
I went to a fucking race
All this maize was solid, just too solid mate
After seeing my matey...
I got clapped, we got a n***a clapped for the wrong look
Then he got tapped, his mind is just too tapped
He is very tapped
I was raised and born in B-A Alum Rock
With all my guys out 'ere
My guys just had 10 bags of coke
Then we smoked all the boys in the casino
Then we just hit that damn big GINO!
Feds asking me questions but i hate nosy people
So dawgs, we just wanna bust up that case
Feds wanna bust up that case but
There is no race, this is not a race
It is a case!
So stop running for your life
Cause you gonna be hunning!




[Intro: Ab Liva]
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh

[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
Up on the corner selling hard like mortar
With loiter
Selling that poison
Dope fiend exploiter
My rented cars
The shell hiding dope
Cops avoid em
Annoy em
Reppin my hood
My skin I embroidered
We cop toys to circle the block
We convoy 'em to blaze
Simply amazing
The young cats enjoy 'em
??? your watch
If they deploy 'em
You got the drop and no sign of that rock
That shit destroy 'em
The young thinkers I employ 'em
See we're cut from the same cloth

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
You should see that motherfucking water boiling on the stove
And those white things floating like it's alka-seltzer cold
They say drugs is a beating so go ahead belt your nose
Or drop it in the pipe and watch it melt into the hole
Crack house like 4am casino, somewhere way out in vegas
All money make you a player
Rolling your life away, smoking your life away
Or go hypodermic nigga, dope it with the white and beige
Speedballing ain't good, recalling
I put Jojo Dancer in them flames, well he bought it
So many nights mama went to bed nauseous
Not that I was involved but her oldest son had fallen
Victim to the pipe dream, I'm lord to the bright lane
The xenon light things, the chain is like lightning
V told me put my first quarter in the ceiling
He meant a quarter million
You niggas thinking like children

Hook:
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
There's nothing like the dealer's feeling
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh
Hiding dope in the ceiling, killing
Willing, trying to make a million
Uh uh, uh uh uh

[Verse 3: Malice]
I'm as dapper as a five on the black hand side
Not even a major label could dampen my stride
Never sacrifice the pride, CEO was Jive talking
I revert to the block from whence all this derived
Heavy with the metal black dual action slide
A few O's shy, you think? Dude let him slide
I'm Emeril with the pot, staring in the pot
Then add that fire to it, BAM! kick it up a notch
I'm handy with koch, I don't deal with the suits
The hen lays golden eggs, who could be so aloof?
Run check the numbers, that's proof enough for me
I am Malcolm with the flow, by any means I'mma eat
First time out the gate nigga's a grammy nominee
But whether rapping or crack, momma's still proud of me
Using her good dishes, leaving them powdery
And that blow in your nose got you sniffing like allergy

[Verse 4: Sandman]
The corner was something my momma kept me banned from
Saying no doubt them dollars would hold me ransom
Only releasing me to frequently be in the
Maybe with the melee, chasing the fast pay day
Come here day-daddy, I ain't going no where
Just up the corner with Brian
I'm lying, only twelve
Trying to inhale the smell they was firing
Hearing them say "pass that"
Watching my uncle, how them yellow cat packs
Rocking them ???
Sweatsuits, its like the corner like swept through
My body and soul and hit me like wool
Officer slow, I'm sixteen and out of control
Momma was right, truly I had to do me
???
Me cheech, gutting Ds, always outside
The corner was live, before ???
I couldn't trust it no more, shit was different
Damn, I grew up with them boys, nigga snitchin
So I switched it, mhm, hop on 9 pound
With my quad pound
With that said, its that bread I must obtain
I yeah I know I stay high, and I'm on my game
And daddy got drive like he bleed octane
He not sane, if I don't see my change
Y'all gonna bleed my pain
Corner mentality, can't get it out of me
Gotta be mint, I am convinced, concrete cement
Go to beam it, you blessed, you test, you die
On the corner you grew up you lie
And meanwhile

[Hook x2]

Franchise, Crosby, American dream
All-star point guard, third year in the lead
First round, number-two pick, the heart of the team
I done set and watch 'em jump off the screen
I done seen and shaken [?] shoes
Fake baseline, [still and step and pull up a tomb??]
It's the franchise, I'll leave a tooth in the game
Boy comes straight out of D.C. doing his thing
The terrapin off in Maryland, chocolate leaves
So [I'll pertain they're 'bout to drop him a sleeve??]
I'm Scarface from the [age dark?], king of the block
"We are one" on my t-shirt and shoes are Reebok
And the streets rock what we rock, the battle is won
Crossbender with the franchise, you know I was done
It's like this, it's like that, it's like this and uh
It's like this, it's like that, it's like this and uh
It's like that, it's like this, it's like that and uh
It's like this, it's like that, it's like that and uh

Def Jam sound, baby!




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1: Common]
Victory won, in a world of Henessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

[Chorus: Bilal]
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone

[Verse 2: Common]
Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run
Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

[Chorus: Bilal]
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone

[Outro: Pops]
Origin is forever
Well, well well
Here we are back in the studio again
Look at that
Hey I don' need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin up the cue cards
What that say?
Oh they say, just talk, don't sing
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever
Through these red eyes, beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of a child
That's forever
Forever is to strive
A place of endearment
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Ok...
I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes
Following the trails of the African slave ships
War, war, and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, is not an, "Oh, what the heck?"
We're still, did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend
The pot of humanity; sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atonement
We gonna work with the four A's here
Forever Pops
Common good is forever...
God's memory is forever...




[Strofa 1: Loco Niggo]
Ok, al mio segnale state pronti oh
A scatenare l'inferno
Sono qua con i diavoli in disco oh
Disco inferno
Col mio flow così fresco brrrrrr
Pare di stare in inverno
Vieni a casa mia a rompe er cazzo oh
Hai sbagliato interno
3-2-1 sono in rampa di lancio
Non faccio musica da offerta lancio
Dal 2004 nel rap game ed è la droga di cui ancora mi faccio
Io 'ste rime le prendo le metto nel grinder le fumo in un bong col ghiaccio
Dottore chiami un dottore
Mi sale la febbra come Maccio
Il mio rap rompe i culi più di Franco Trentalance sul set
Fumo 30 tipi diversi di ganje sbianco e vado fuori di me
Ho sbrattato addosso a un agente prima di fare un alcool test
Ogni sera per me è come se fosse l'Oktoberfest
Che ne dici me le compro settecento mila miliardi di views?
Così i rapper che spaccano tutto non se li sentono più
Fuck you, fangù, YouTube, io sbub
Do a tutti il benvenuto nella mia Panic Room
Io non capisco perché la gente tutto a un tratto ha iniziato a farsi foto al cesso
E sto tipo che mi fa la richiesta ma guarda un po' come cazzo sta messo
Tu vuoi fare il rap beh non capisco dove sia il nesso
'Ste pischelle in foto le vedi solo in faccia fa schifo il resto

[Ritornello: Loco Niggo]
Nigga in Rome, Nigga in Rome
Quando dici Pattada dici Nigga in Rome
Nigga in Rome, Nigga in Rome
Quando dici Pattada dici Nigga in Rome

[Strofa 2: Nayt]
Vivo per arrivare al trono
Illumino le nuvole come un tuono
Pensavi io fossi altruista e buono
Ascolti solo quello che non stono
Non mi serve comandare
Se non faccio parte della gente (vai)
A me viene da stomacare
Quando non vedi che non sei niente (bye)
So, mille modi per andare veloce qua non fermando la voce ma non li ho mai studiati
E voi, vi chiudete co una vita precoce sapendo che non la farete mai incapaci
È troppo presto per dimostrarti quello che studi da anni
Visto il contesto e inquadrati gli altri nessuno regge i miei panni
Peace, senti, giocare contro me ne-nel rap
È come sfidare tre-tre tredddi a tris, perdi
Il mio flow si espande e sconfina
La vita è troia a me mi spompina
Non decollo ma, neanche mollo qua
Rappo sempre vai Nayt continua...




[Intro]
With good understanding
And a lot of patience
You can make it, yes you can
Beyond your wildest dreams

[Verse 1]
Here we are in the prime of life
We're so ripe
Yeah the time's right
Here we go and we're high of expectations
Let's not waste them

[Hook]
Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take it
We can make it

[Bridge]
Don't wait til tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow, let's go
Don't wait til tomorrow
We waited all our lives
Don't waste another day

[Verse 2]
Hesitation will only get you nowhere
Don't just stand there
Every moment is a gift
Here's your moment to live
Don't have no fear

[Hook]
Oh the sunshine in your eyes could break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take it
We can make it

[Outro]
It's our time
It's our evening
Don't let it slip away
Tomorrow's too late
It's our night, please don't leave me
If you're lost I'll help you find your way
Your way to tomorrow
Oh don't you know we're gonna get together
Your way to tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow
Oh we're gonna get together




[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Interlude: Chris Brown & Drake]
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

[Verse 7: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself

[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her




[George Bush]
"I'm not a hater... I don't hate Conway West. I was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races."

In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum

[Intro]
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie
(Perfect!)

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(You!)

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for, huh?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Outro]
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him




Oh, OK

[Chorus]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is -- when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound (swerve)
(swerve)

[Verse 1]
OK, drop it to the floor
Make that ass shake
Woah make the ground move, that’s an ass-quake
Built a house up on that ass, that’s an ass-state
Roll my weed on it, that’s an ass-tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don’t we do this err’ day-day?
I work them long nights, long nights to get a payday
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin’, so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I’m Perrierin’
White girls politicin’ that’s that Sarah Palin
Gettin’ high, Californicatin’
I give her that D, cause that’s where I was born and raised in

[Chorus]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo

(swerve, swerve, swerve)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it’s prime time, my top back, this pimp game ho
I’m red leather, this cocaine, I’m Rick James ho
I’m bill droppin’, Ms. Pacman is pill poppin’ ass ho
I’m poppin’ too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that’s real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin’, that’s exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras
That’s Swiss time and that’s excellence
Two door preference
Roof gone George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Heinz is irrelevant
Lambo, Mercy-lago, she go wherever I go
Wherever we go we do it pronto


[Chorus]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is -- when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound (swerve)
(swerve, swerve, swerve)

[Verse 3]
Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I’m fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I’m the shit
Tell ‘em “Give me fifty million or I’mma quit”
Most rappers taste level ain’t at my waist level
Turn up the bass ’til it’s up in your face level
Don’t do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus your my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Something’ ’bout Mary she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin’ they body
Don’t sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin’ just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[Verse 4]
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I’m drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin’ champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a band aid
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin’
All my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign
Money tall like Jordan


[Chorus]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is -- when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound

[1. Part]
Ich kriege schon wieder so ein Deja Vu
Mit ein'm Reim von hier und einer Zeile von da
Bite und prahl, sag warum hast du keine Gun, Clown?
Ok ich weiß, weil wieder Spassten deine Gun klau'n
Schlag deinen Ast von meinem Stammbaum und mach mich frei
Du hast nie Dues gepaid, du musst Lehrgeld zahl'n
Mehr tun als bei Amis nach Rhymes im Sperrmüll kram'n
Mehr tun als zu connecten wie der Ärmelkanal
Was du machst hat keine Roots, fuck deine Roots
Ich baue Satzreime als wärn's Backsteine, Fool
Denn du weißt wer und ich hoff du weißt was
Also komm nie mehr an und sag deine Crew sei krass
Chico das ist meine Stadt und du bist nur zu Besuch
Schieb keinen Harten im Klub, du bist nur zu Besuch
Im Sturzflug zum Ruhm und vielleicht einmal nach oben
Ich weiß noch dein Geburtstag wurde drei mal verschoben
Du bist klein, verlogen, stolz auf Steine die funkeln
Nenn mich "Fluoris-Sentence" denn ich scheine im Dunkel'n
Klar dass du mit deinen Lifestyle verfluchte Neider hast
Doch ich finde dich at Nightheim und schub mit einer Glock

[2. Part]
Eko der Epigon, Savas in Betaversion
Ich ruf an in Brüssel damit sie keine Rapper mehr klon'n
Du hast nie im Ghetto gewohnnt, nie ne Beretta geowned
Nie hat vor ihm jemand wacker geflowed
Aber seit kurzer Zeit sieht Keko mehr Frau'n
Und nimmt sie mit nach Hause und liest Echo der Frau
Optik-Fan, Gossip-Clan, ich bin topfit, man, Big Sen knockt dich, man
Von Berlin bis BK ich prügele Clowns
Tätowier dir lieber Freeway über den Bauch
Du aufs Cover der Source, ich glaube kaum du Hater
Los zieh dein Cap bis zu den Augenbrau'n wie Jada
Nur damit sie keiner sieht diese Angst in deinem Blick
Vergiss die weiten Jeans hol ne Gun mit einem Clip
Nimm jeden [?] Reim und hol dein Wörterbuch raus
Denn darin steckt die Realness für den Vers den du brauchst
Danke für den guten Rat, in Sachen Job in einer Bar
Lieber broke und stolz, als Clown im Schatten eines Stars
Ich kacke meine Bars, andere essen sie auf
Verdaun' jedes Wort und spucken es aus
Oft wissen viele garnich wieviel Plan ich besitz
Und schon morgen gibt es Mittags Sizilianischen Fisch
Yo, das mit dem Wiederholen, das war meine Idee
Ich bin nicht Dieter Bohlen, doch das war meine Idee




[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & No I.D.]

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yuugh!

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh?




[Kanye West]
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique
Any street

Father is the black Bruce Wayne
Only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains

If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress




[Intro]
Aiiyo GRAV, shiiit
Aiiyo GRAV man; Aiiyo who's laughing man?!
Aiiyo get up nigga man it's time to go do this shit bee
Aiiyo GRAV, Aiiyo GRAV wake up man
Aiiyo GRAV bee, wake up nigga
Yo! GRAV what the fuck is goin' on man?!
What the fuck man?! Why is this nigga shakin' like that?!
Aiiyo wassup with this nigga's eyes yo!
Aiiyo somethin' wrong with GRAV yo!
Aiiyo! *intelligible dialog* GRAV nigga
Yo! This nigga's shakin' yo!
Yo! GRAV! What the fuck bee?!
Wake the fuck up nigga!
Aiiyo! somethin' wrong with GRAV!
Somethin' wrong with GRAV!

[Verse 1]
Now often goes me like yo! here goes
That ox again sucking up all the oxygen from Earth
Givin' birth to phat styles so hide when I release my carbon dioxide
Detrimental to your health, tonic makes flesh bubble and boil
Fools quote in coils
So now they're strong on a power that's god
Lay in hardly any other can fathom
Watch me gather 'em up
In my congregation they'll be no hesitation
In my nation's reservation
That means I begin the mutating of a lyrical terror
All wack shit will get severed
Brain cells be in the process of amputation
All cerebral penetration must cease
I release a form of verbal death that by far
Will leave your whole mental scared

[Hook]
Sick thoughts on my mind x 7
With no self control

[Verse 2]
I have tendencies to make wack MCs' backbones break, bend
As my rap style ascends
We can rip limb from limb
Body parts get severed from my lyrical endeavors
We ain't all in this together
Because self-made get to top mountain peaks
While all you others stay weak
See it's survival of the fittest
So I rid dis fan of every hip-hop coal who ain't real
When punks try to get rid of me
The result is molecular instability
The outcome from a vet verses molecule
Disperse the atoms split from adoption
So now capture my dreams and jack me in the veins
Let me enter your blood stream
Kid I watch your head swell
As the game gets hard and I bombard your brain cells
See my prediction of the mental constriction
Is the restriction of train of thought have you in your corpse
In the fact that this is real --
You say virtual reality so kid why would you battle me?
See I'm the only crowd pleaser
Your skull will finally bust and you'll catch amnesia
Friends and family you won't be remembering
I leave you comatose trembling

[Bridge]
Aiiyo this nigga ain't gettin' up man
Man, Yo! GRAV get up!
Sick thoughts on my mind
What the fuck?! Stop playin' man, yo!
Fuck that shit man!
Quit pla- man fuck it get this nigga's wallet then
Sick thoughts on my mind x 2

[Verse 3]
Psychology and Chemistry is my claim to fame
Mixing lyrical concoctions for the brain
Through aural intake metamorphosis starts
Veins steadily pump poison through my heart
Check my cardiological expand
Forming to be on top of then mortal man
My skin transforms into flammable gases
Everything I touch disintegrates into ashes
So surpass this, lyrical mics that melt in hands
Burning more niggas glass jaws back to sand
Scorch in the gorge of the Earth
Agriculture from these fake vulture niggas tryin' to feed of the land
Death by cremation to those who reprimand me
Axing out clear rouge styles that's uncanny
They're scared, when ever I walk the streets
My feet leave red burnt marks on concrete

Sick thoughts on my mind [laughter]
Get up GRAV man
Yo! GRAV get up man
Aiiyo GRAV....

...Ooh shit!
Yo! what the fuck is wrong with you man?

Act up, bring the K's to ya city
Then shots exchangin, every single day

[Chrous w/o (on me!)] x2




Preface

In this conversation, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams candidly explore the rewards and perils of a lifelong, perfectionist ethic. Best likened to a child's insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious – and comic – insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single “Theraflu”, which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label (in collaboration with DJ Khaled, DJ Pharris and the producer Hit Boy). Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric “someone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor,” which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group

Kanye West: Yo yo, what’s good?!

Pharrell Williams: What up, killer?!

KW: Shit, chillin’, vibin’ about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the “Theraflu” song?

PW: Yeah

KW: Yeah, we’re about to give it a new name

PW: It’s getting that big – they’re going that crazy about it?

KW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here’s still a window of opportunity for us to change it. “Oh, well, I don’t want to call it ‘Theraflu’. I’m calling the song this…” And then people are like, “oh, he changed the song to this”, and then that’s what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?

PW: Yeah, trust me, they’re thankful. No matter what, they’re thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be – and I know how I feel about it – but you’re definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say “He gets it, but I’d love to hear his take on why we aspire to be.” It’s almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, “I know that they don’t get it but maybe one day they will.”

KW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I’m going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it’s just if you’re a perfectionist, that’s just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have – with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure – to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There’s a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you’re a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders

PW: Yeah I agree…You know what the funny thing is that we’ve never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that

KW: Yeah!

PW: It might be time for that

KW: Yeah, we started on that shit for [Watch] The Throne

PW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment…

KW: Yes!

PW: I’ll never forget going to you and Jay’s show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated – you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I’ll never forget when the first bars of “Gotta Have It” started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y’all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it’s really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?

KW: Yeah, it’s only ‘cause it happens

PW: [laughs] yeah, you know I don’t know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like “oh, ok, well done man, well done.”

KW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together

PW: Mmmmm. I like that!

KW: Just like that!

PW: Wow, I can’t wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we’ve gone through, and by having spirituality – in whatever way you define it – it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. [But] there is something to be said for experience, being told “no” the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?

KW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of “no’s” and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, “mink is draggin’ on the floor.” That’s one of my ideas for it [renaming ‘Theraflu’]. “Swag King Cole, mink is dragin’ on the floor, fo’ I embarrass you, but I don’t like to embarrass you…’I Don’t Like To Embarrass You” as the title

PW: Anticipating PETA

KW: Yeah, so…when I say “I’m from where shorty’s fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it.”

PW: Yeah, “you do it!”

PW: [laughs]

KW: “I’m from Chicago.” And that was just one of the best things to prepare me for anything. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. That’s what I’m talking about on this new song, that’s what I’m talking about when I’m dealing with any business or creative processes. That’s the stuff I’m talking about when I was dealing with people, from not wanting me to rap, to [not] doing the tour with Jay, and being able to do the light show for it It was like sit-ins, when we were going out to Paris. You know when we were wearing the outfits and people on the blogs were calling us names and all that, right? But then, once they got that Givenchy cover, and everybody’s wearing Givenchy they’re all like “oh this is cool.”

PW: Right

KW: But it wasn’t cool with South Park was using the photo and dissing us and everything. And so many people dress like that now

PW: [Laughs in agreement] Yeah, that’s what we do

KW: That was before everybody said swag, or when we were out in Japan. How could you communicate through people? We’re not even understanding the language but we knew the visual language, we knew the spirit, we knew the ideas, we knew the reference points

PW: Yeah, that’s the thing, man. That’s what separates us from a lot of folk, and not because we’re better but because we’ve dedicated to listen to that inner voice, and a lot of people don’t. A lot of people go “man!” they do something and they go “shit you know what, and I’m totally not da-da-da-da [fill in the blanks].” People fail a lot of times doing that. Whereas we just trained ourselves to say “you know what, let me entertain this idea” and exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that it doesn’t make sense because something good may come out of that and for every time that someone has ever told you no, you’ve always had that willingness to explore it. Um, and I’ve watched that by the way, it’s been cool to see. How are you enjoying that…

KW: - Enjoying what?

PW: I’m thinking of a way to put it…How are you enjoying this whole fame thing?

KW: [gasp] You know its just a process of separating things, it’s understanding how to exploit it to display things, it’s understanding how to exploit it to display amazing art. You know the whole trick is that I am a visual artist. To this day I can’t play piano. I’ve taken it up a couple of times and I forget how to play the piano. And when I first wanted to rap, before I rapped, the first thing I did was actually draw my tape covers because that’s back when people had tapes. I drew the cover before I even thought about doing music. Let’s put this information in Vegas to music. So ina  way I’ll get the music but it was always about the fountain. It was always about the light show. It was always about the fashion show, it was always about that. Whether it is the font that we pick for a single cover, or a video – I’m going to Qatar later tonight to shoot the film for “Cruel Summer,” which is basically my second pop fairytale, like how “Runaway” was – it creates that kind of opportunity. When you see me design, and I’m not saying it’s the best design or whatever, but you know, [in “Runaway”] I had my idea of how I wanted Selita [Ebanks] to look, and I wanted it to be Selita. I wanted to juxtapose minimalist, Vanessa Beecroft like high art against unrealistic Victoria Secret-level beauty.  They don’t crash, those words are not in the same place. You’ve been to art parties before? It’s different from a Victoria Secret’s party. You know what I’m talking about!

PW: Right!

KW: That’s right. Due to exposure, I’m able to have these things be seen by so many people. If Matthew Barney were more famous, then more people would see what Matthew Barney did. So it’s that. When it comes down to it, what I enjoy about it is the opportunity to express art in high volume, literally

PW: Did you know that you’re a synesthete? That you have synesthesia?

KW: That’s what it’s called, that’s what the film is about! You’re talking about seeing sounds right?

PW: There are many different forms of synesthesia. There are grapheme synethetes, people who see colors in numbers, letters in colours. But I believe most musicians and most artists are synesthetes

KW: You know that’s what this film in Qatar is about!

PW: Oh wow!

KW: It’s called Cruel Summer: The Legend of the Lamborghini Dons  and it’s basically the G.O.O.D Music Lamborghini Dons. [Kid] Cudi, he’s the main character and I’m just this boy, and in the beginning we’re car thieves. There’s this part where one character teaches another to see colours through sound

PW: Oh wow!

KW: Yeah, the shit is dope. Matter of fact, if we could do work with you on the soundtrack. I mean I’ve got eight tracks for it, I just want to give it twelve. Basically it’s the G.O.O.D Music soundtrack that “Mercy” is the first single for. You’re like next level with this type of shit like [sings] “Take me far away, as long as it’s fun, fun, fun, I wanna go.” I’m talking to actually a film scorer at this point so –

PW: No! But dude….Nah man! It’s funny that you picked that out [“Fun, Fun Fun”]. That’s funny, wow!

KW: I play that song real normal in the car

PW: No way?!

KW: Yeah!

PW: That’s crazy, that’s crazy. ‘Aight well say no more. I’mma holla at you soon. And you have a good time out there in Qatar. My man!

KW: Alright, thanks! Love




[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
It's been a long ride, but I made it here with love
I made it here with love, love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it has, yeah
Before a love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya
Oh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds, I'm movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yeah, gotta love yourself
Uh, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I decided not to use my color as a handicap
He a designer, artist, producer, and he rap
Never found virtue from patience
In a dark room just pacin'
Precious time is just wastin'
You do not know what we facin'
I cannot be complacent
In my job, be courageous
Another kid just got shot
They can't find the assailant
Made it out of the basement
Made it out of the underground
From a time where you outta town
They might gun you down, blaow
There goes another round, blaow
There goes another round
Came from this Chi and wow, look what the fuck they found
A young legend, comin' to shut the summer down
You need to talk to me like you don't bring your mother 'round

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
I don't feel no ways tired
Can't get restless in my soul
Hold your heart, the world is cold
Keep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman
Yeah, it will come to pass
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
God knows that you're worth it
You deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else
Somebody else




[Intro]
Finally Famous in this..

[Verse 1]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back
When
I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had
It all figured out

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it.. all of it... when you still ain't got....

[Outro]
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame




[Chorus: Kanye West]
Everybody, let's go
Don't stop baby, don't stop me
Don't stop baby, don't stop me
I like the way that you move
And girl you know how I do

[Verse 1- Fonzworth Bentley]
It's in your hip
I want to get right between your strip
Use it like Lancome lipstick
Scarlett, and frankly I really do care, madam
All you will, this is Sa-Ra fam, now back to ma'am
I know that you can move like that I saw you dance
And now you you gotta show out, make me a fan
Turn up the fan, we gonna sweat crazy
What's your favorite Gatorade, lady
Hadn't been shopping, Perrier water maybe
I hope you ain't hungry got mash but no gravy
But we can make some, the best of both juices
We can use this, this some new shit
Make it hot like Crisco
That's how my flow go, shorty you ain't know?
If you ain't po, stop being so high post
My music ain't just for the siditty and pretty it's for

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Everybody, let's go
Don't stop baby, don't stop me
Don't stop baby, don't stop me
I like the way that you move
And girl you know how I do
[Verse 2- André 3000]
Shorty you killin' 'em hard with them lady pants
Simple elegance looking better when you dance
Chest to the sun with your thoroughbred stance
You gallop to the rhythms of a native drum chant
Your granny must be Navajo
Your mama do rodeo, your papa do the saville row
I bite you, ain't no antidotes
The red blouse do arouse, I come at you like a matador
Does attract horny bulls
All the girls are waiting to see which one he pulls
Eenie meenie miney meenie prenuptial
Enforcer in the Porsche in case fools wanna duel
You'll cool your fuckin jets, who wanna be next?
Ooh, I'll probably get life if I let
One off, so I let em go like a pro
Sir Andre with an accent 3 triple 0
Ben-jamin, Lauren is the middle name
That was given by my mama, success was on her brain
Rain? Bentley Farns got the umbrellas
Benjamin got the sweaters, hey what more can we sell em?
Sun, spring will bring the parasol
Now watch him parasail to entertain us all

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Everybody, let's go
Don't stop baby, don't stop me
Don't stop baby, don't stop me
I like the way that you move
And girl you know how I do




Me and you, babygirl, is like best friends
Let me hit you when I get the notion
On I-55, you and I, let's ride, hittin' on potion
Some say she's flicky-flicky
Lemme kiss yo' little 'neeta
I'm bending through the backs and curves
Inhale, exhale the herb

Let me open up your mind to this concept
Hit this, 'B, and take one step
If you listen to the words from a wordsmith
As the herb shift
To the curb while my 22" spins
In my baby-blue Benz
Girls say, "That boy is acting up, but
That's the way he is."

You lookin' good when you steppin' out a centerfold
Tell me - would we, baby? Can I reach a pinnacle?
But ever since I did a dime in this street game
They left a motherf**ker cold, and you know it
I'll put you in a beat and I'll blow it
Keep it real with the bitches and I never sugarcoat it
You like tight herb and when I pull up to the curb it's like
When I pull up to the curb it's like

When I'm laying in the back of my 745
With my lips on you
Spittin' good game
Blowin' smoke through the woodgrain
Gettin' brain like a hustlah should
A hustlah would
Chasin' paper to the ? (senators,city dust, silly ducks?)
She said, "I'll run it through my hands and lungs"
What that do?
In the middle of your index and thumb
Baby girl, you just got me sprung
What that do?

Oh yes, she's one of the best
That I've touched in the past tense
Now I'm hurtin'
Lurkin', searchin' for the merchants
Coz I know that baby girl is workin'
To the end of the roach she's smokin'
To the hands to the Ziplock's closin'
It's like Teddy Pendergrass but she wants an autograph
But the sex is closin'

Open back up
Last time
Coz' a little dark off (?) in my mind
She's just like one of a kind
No "C"s, no stayin' behind
This just like top of the line
Perfect, wanna drop in her dime
I'm on a roll again
I'm 'bout to blow again

Babygirl, I can't pretend
Your love got me high - on ten
We mix like juice n' gin
Do or Die - we at it again

Whether you ride in a six or the fin
Shot out to my niggas in the pen
Tatted up with a few dead friends
Do or Die - we at it again

Babygirl, I can't pretend
Your love got me high - on ten
We mix like juice n' gin
Do or Die - we at it again




[Hook]
I speak the truth
Truth, nothin but the truth
Y'all know what I bring to the game I speak the truth
The truth, nothing but the truth

[Verse 1: Beanie Mac]
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
Cuz you know I'm known to melt a wire or two
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down cracks that's real to save
Hit the studio, jars of dro, bars to blow
B. Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that, don't hold me back
I roll with crack, y'all cats told Mac to rap
Y'all don't realize y'all released the beast untame
Speech all flame, streets y'all blame
It should be an honor for y'all to speak my name
I could go before your honor sit and peep my game
Gotta laugh, y'all acted like it spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers can't get in the game
I come from high school, and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Verse 2: Beanie Mac]
Ain't nothin changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed, that's fine still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Y'all niggas can't stop the BOL, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm
You wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed this song
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Mac]
Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

[Hook]




My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And this rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prisons
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
(Puppet, oh)
You control me (Control me)
I'm your puppet (Puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me (Puppet)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...
...on a...
First, light the weed
First...
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
(Oh, Lord)

[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(Cut me loose)
(La, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(Cut me loose, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But at some point, you come to your senses




[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit




[Verse 1 - Beanie Sigel]
You can't tell me nothing
Gangster? I don't buy it -- you can't sell me nothing
I'm everything you thought I wasn't
Now check out how I does it on this K. West production
All your bullshit, I will flush it
And I got the paper to wipe that ass
Every little song and dance come out, y'all hype that trash
And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

[Hook - Kanye West]
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
Well, [Young Jeezy: If I had a billion dollars]
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname "Sorrow"
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Uncle Murda]
Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner
They goners

You're such a freaky—

I'm a real freak, I need a real freak (Whoop!)

[Intro]
Yeah, I see you big bro
I'mma kill these niggas man, yeah

[Verse 1]
Straight off the block with it (Block with it)
Eagle Street to be specific (Be specific)
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference (Keep the difference)
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racing, I'm just sprinting
'Cause I don't wanna finish (Wanna finish)
They diminish, I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world, ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since twelve thirty (Twelve thirty)
AM, weigh them, if they short, take them
Right back and spray him, amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thing, yeah
Believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em to something
I'm just repel 'em, I'mma kill 'em
Someone tell 'em, I'mma kill 'em
I'm gon' fill 'em up, his momma can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'mma kill 'em and yeah we sell 'em
I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki go for twenty, half a ki go for eleven
After me there will be nothing
I Am Legend, and I Will Smith
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

[Chorus]
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, bitch
And the beat goes
Boom B-Boom B-Boom
Boom B-Boom B-Boom, it goes
Boom B-Boom B-Boom, now say

[Verse 2]
Heh, c’mon
Just a snare and a 808
Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A
OK, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle
From giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350
Tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'mma take it one-two-way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool
At Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool
As I blew by you
Hello, hi you
I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you
Feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing
I show and prove
And show improvement
And I know just to go into it
Could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you wanna do it
We can do it like we late
Ay, wait
Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

[Chorus]
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
And the beat goes
Boom B-Boom B-Boom, it goes
Boom B-Boom Boom, the beat goes
Boom B-Boom Boom, now everybody say, yeah

[Bridge]
That I am the best rapper alive
I am the best rapper alive
And I will eat you alive
Think I'm lyin'?

[Verse 3]
Damn
I'mma get in a nigga chest like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fucking ram
On the hunt for the lamb
I'mma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam
Hair nappy like Pam
Nigga fuck your plan
Fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man
And fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh god damn
There's my sam–ple
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared
Suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos, and I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat bitch

[Chorus]
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now what's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, they say
And the beat goes
Boom B-Boom B-Boom, it goes
Boom B-Boom Boom, the beat goes
Boom B-Boom Boom, now everybody say, yeah
And the beat goes
Boom B-Boom B-Boom, it goes
Boom B-Boom Boom, the beat goes
Boom B-Boom B-Boom, they say




And all the crazy shit I did, that'll make the best memories
Seems my old friends always make the best enemies
Can't make ends, without making bills
And you can't ask fake niggas to keep it real
Baby, I can't, I can't, I can't, argue no more
When the only thing deep about you is your throat
Why you always rock the boat?
I swear you harder to read than a doctor's note
I put my demons on the page
And put my passion on the stage
Crashing on the websites, spazzing on the websites
Driving on the wrong side, crash into the waves
Surfs up, tide's low, so you can see the stakes, drive slow
You in the presence of ghetto royalty
Do what the fuck we want and pay the lawyer fees
I'm in Paris driving in the same lane
Where Princess Diana was killed by the damn fame
The lonely king, who's only flaw is
Looking for somebody that's flawless
No fairy tale, no ending to this story book
This could very well be the same road that glory took
Or Maria Antoinette, the fall of the Rome
The ghost of the fallen king is calling me home




[Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, they say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

[Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, they say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin' "Damn, Ye snapped with this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask him how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin' with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon' check myself in - again

[Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, they say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 3: Common]
They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen the corner, now they say "That nigga's back," uh

[Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, they say...)
They don't knowwwww




[Intro]
It's still bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

[Verse 1]
One thing 'bout music when it's real they get scared
Got us slavin' for the welfare
Ain't no food, clothes, or healthcare
I'm down for guerilla warfare
All my niggas put your guns in the air if you really don't care
Skunk in the air, make a nigga wanna buck in the air
For my brother locked up in the jump for a year
Shit is real out here don't believe these videos
This fake ass industry gotta pay to get a song on the radio
Really though, DP's gon' let you know
It's just a game of pimps and hoes
And it's all 'bout who you know
Not who we are, or how we grow
I rap 'bout what I know, what I go through
What I been through, not just for no dough
Even though the rent due, what I'm into ain't for no dough
Or just no fame, everything must change, nothin remains the same
Sick of the same ol' thang, it's bigger than bling bling

[Refrain]
If I, feel it I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real then I probably won't
Rollin with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die
Uhh, hip what hop what hip what hop what hip what hop what hip what
Hop c'mon, c'mon, my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop means sayin' what I want, never bite my tongue
Hip-hop means teachin' the young
If you feelin' what I'm feelin' then you hearin' what I'm sayin'
Cause these fake fake records just keep on playin'
What you sayin huh DP bringin' the funk
Let the bass-line rattle your trunk, uh
Punk pig wit a badge wanna handcuff me cause my pants that's tend to sag
Hip-hop means throw up your rag, soldier flag
Whether ridin on the bus or you stole a jag
M-1 mean freedom, burn the cash
Revolutionary love til the day we pass
Will they play it on the radio
Maybe not, maybe so we gon keep it pumpin' though
Everybody know we headed for the whoa, fo sho

[Verse 3]
Ay dogg that label is that slave ship
Owners got them whips and rappers is slaves
If you really wanna eat you gotta hear the same thing
With the football, b-ball, or if you slangin that dope
Ain't never seen no hope, brainwash video shows be foolin my folk
What the hell a brother gon do though, huh
When the rent due, when the lights and the gas gonna get cut off
Drop them raps or cock them gats
Ain't never had shit ever since we came to this bitch
Why I gotta feel pain to get rich
'Stead of stackin' chips, finna pack them clips

[Refrain 2]
If I, feel it I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real then I probably won't
Rollin with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die
Ride to this if you miss 2Pac
Bounce to this if you love Big Poppa
My soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die

Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

[Refrain 2]




[Skit]
Due to the supply of this content
Parental discretion is advise
Wanna be a monument to physical perfection
You wanna be a shrine
You should be
You want to change right
Oh you got to change

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich
40 mill with some acres, makeup for my bitch
I don't fuck with these niggas, stop pretending and shit
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be famous
Fuck around, be a Lennon and a fan leave you brainless
All in the paper, gettin' buried  by a neighbor
While all of your relatives spendin' all the money that you gave 'em
Fuck it, don't save 'em
Let that boy drown if he don't float, guess he wasn't made for it
My nigga hold it, hold it down, listenin' to underground
Poppin' knuckles cause these niggas wanna bring me down
Put your face in the dirt like 4th down
Niggas wanna test, but we will never fail
I'm layin' low in my day clothes
Can't get a fuckin' meal at Pollo Loco without takin' photos
Man, these little crazy niggas (loco)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich
40 mill with some acres, makeup for my bitch
I don't fuck with these niggas, stop pretending and shit
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich


[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be famous
Flip a finger, middle finger, let 'em know that I'm dangerous
All my niggas bangers, Chevy riding swingers
And my bitch'll fight ya, Hilary Swank ya
Take your bitch, we ain't even swingers
Nigga, try your luck, think it's all entertainment
You all in arraignment, snitchin' to the plaintiff
Who, what, where? My niggas stay nameless
Knock down yo' doo' for that dough
My niggas they go when I say go
These bitches fuckin' cause they hoes
They hoes for that motherfuckin' fame

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich
40 mill with some acres, makeup for my bitch
I don't fuck with these niggas, stop pretending and shit
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich


[Outro]
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
I don't need the proof
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
Nigga, that's the proof
Niggas talkin', that's bulletproof
Run and shoot
Niggas talkin' like they bulletproof
My niggas, they run and shoot

[Skit]
Love those bitches
They love to eat
It's ok
It's important
This being brook
You gotta stop man




[Hook]
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'd reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played the big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'd never rock a mink coat in the summertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the wintertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
People not sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks or Adidos
Can they add that he just spazzed out at that show?
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India.Arie award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please award
But I'll just take the I Got A Lot of Cheese award

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
Everybody talkin', but when it hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Bridge]
Keep the pianos goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
I got to keep it goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

[Verse 3]
When I wrote this dope shit, what I noticed was so bogus
A lot of people talk about you when you growin' up
But you got to stay focused
People who was number one in school end up like smokers
People you talk the most about
No doubt, sometimes end up the dopest
Anybody know they can't touch the way I flow
I guess it was the way I run from school to school
And sometimes wasn't treaten cool and broke all the rules
And always ended up in the office like Michael Scott
Now I got rings like Michael got
That's Jordan, let me tell you somethin' more important
You think I wrote this, no, it just comes off the top of my
Whatever topic I
Stop it, I'm probably the best out, Mr. West out
Yo, don't nobody want to bout
I knock people out in the first round. the first down
Hear the touchdown, y'all don't even want to clown
With the red shoes on just to let you know I'm freestylin'
Yes, ill, I'm wilin'
I see you, uh, at the mall to show this is my mornin' flow
So imagine my midnight sight when I ignite lyrically
I just might, everybody just bite
When I wrote this, I was picturin' a little girl in high school
With people pickin' on her, tellin' her what she not
Then she'd grow up to be model, so they'll be hot
And everything she not made her slam it
Everything she not made it everything she am
That's incorrect English, but I'm way too distinguished
Can understand this, I rock the planets
Cameras be candid, on, I was lookin' at my prior image
My wire image, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin', get it?

[Hook]
Damn, damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Bridge]
And I'm a keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And you just keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

[Outro] (x3)
Now when they get hard, I need you to keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them




[Verse 1: Kanye West & (Big Sean)]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on (whoa)
You should just go and throw a cape on (whoa)
And it’s just so amazing

[Interlude: Kanye West]
There goes the bed
There go there goes the bed sheets
There goes the bed
There go there goes the bed sheets
There goes the bed
There go there goes the bed sheets
There goes the bed
There go there goes the bed sheets

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Pre-Verse: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
She love the way I’m doing it (she do it)
So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on-on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'mma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We at it all day)
It’s our day (It's like this always)
It’s our way (After a long day)
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Pre-Verse: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Talk to the, talk to the, hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'mma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We at it all day)
It’s our day (It's like this always)

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man




[Intro: Marcus Garvey]
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess what, baby? I feel free (Scoop)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

[Verse: Kanye West]
Created in nah-nah-nah
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
Ah! I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
You should quit your job to this
Hold up, let 'em drop the mist
Got on the concert
One stunt in yours, don't stunt on us
They stunted on, ah
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
This like a mix of some Ja Rule shit and some King Krule shit
Don't assume shit, the news shit
This a fool shit, I'm on some bullshit
I'm on some wildin' out in some new shit
I'm on somethin', 'bout to lose it
Take your con and does it, don't double fools it
Lyor come up arguin' saying, "Don't lose the music"
I got none' but cool shit, I been known to lose it
You stuck with a bunch of motherfuckers you don't know
Like a cruise ship
Hottest on new shit, bangin' on that new shit
Popstar, move it
Man, he goin' foolish
Man, he goin' stupid
Man, he got the movement
Now they couldn't move it
Talkin' in jewels, yeah

[Outro: Kanye West]
Can't not bump 'em anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
(Shut the fuck up and go suck some penises)




[Intro: The-Dream]
I wanna see what's under therrrrrrrre...baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
Wii can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs ?light up? when they're in them shoes, ohhh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl
(She's my digital girl)

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl
(She's my digital girl)

[Verse 4: The-Dream] {Kanye West}
Baby, not a day goes byyyy... (Whoaaaaa...) (Eh, shawty)
Without you on my miiiind... (Whoaaaaa...) (Eh, shawty)
Donna Karan underweaaaaar... (Whoooa-HOA..) (Eh shwaty)
{Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about)
Baby, I wanna see what's under therrrre... {It's easy, look lemme explain..}
(Oh baby, yeah baby!)

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach 3rd base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date?
"'Ye, the picture just looks so trash"
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacey Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady aaaaat, it
You know what's a crazy thing?
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, 33-Year Old Virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
"Baby you up," Question mark
And she respond, "YES-S-S-I-R"

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl
(She's my digital girl)

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, uh no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no {fades}




[Hook: Nina Simone]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Good God! Midwest coast back, nigga
And don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black, nigga
Free country, they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all their white daughters drinkin' Hennessy
I'mma go to Sal's with some niggas on the wall
I might go to Oz, take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano's so involved
I know, King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had two Polos
We the kids they'll keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They ask about the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff
You know

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Children of Jah
Children of Jah
Children of Jah, put your hands up




[Nina Simone Sample]
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange Fruit

[Hook: John Legend]
Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up today
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

[Verse 1: Common]
Black bodies on the wall, color from years ago
It's spiritual the way that them tears they fell slow
Roots and bruises so deep, found it hard to sleep
Souls lost in the heat, pray to God to keep
Fast forward to my pop, he nod and geeked-off the Heron
Still he was dead to bear arms
Thats where I'm from, my story ain't that different from yours
A blood line, a hard time, prisons and wars
With struggle it came rain, when it rains it pours
We stayed between liquor stores, and "praise the Lord"
Singing "we shall overcome" cause we came for more
We were dancing for it to rain no more
Though hurricanes and waves they came ashore
Takin' lives of the brave and poor
They'd ignore, us once again
But it was lessons in the wind
Of change that came from within
So...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
Wonder if I make it to heaven, will I get a chance to party
And celebrate with the great black bodies
Im talking bout Marley, Nina, and Marcus Garvey
Similair to Africa the streets is our safari
From shanties in slums, is children with guns
AIDS and poverty killing our young
Gramps keep sayin a savior gon' come
For the meek and the humble favor gon' come
From the same trees we were hung, we can see the sun
In the darkest hour, our power begun
I write from the same place they were bleedin' from
I'm emceein they done until the streets is won
So far we've come, with so far to go
To do the impossible only God will know-how we do it
I speak it and I put it in the music
The struggle lives through it, its a movement so move it

[Hook]
Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate
Celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate
Oooooo you got to
Dance little brother,(oooh) dont give up the fight.(Dont give up the fight)
Hang on 'til tomorrow,(oooh) the truth will come to light.(will come to light
Dance little sister,(ooh) don't give up the day.(dont give up today)
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate




CyHi! It's like two in the morning
Slayed two bitches inside of my California bed
Fuck it, I was horny
Haha, so God, please don't judge me
It ain't my fault you ain't make these hoes ugly
Cheese on Chuck E, Clicquot fuzzy
Streets gon' love me, freaks gon' fuck me
How could a young nigga be so lucky?
No Luciano, truly, I know
I done changed since I used to do the cornrow
They only give you credit at the end of movies, I know
Hustled since I learned how to use a lawnmower
From the traphouse, now I do the condo
I was in the street, nigga you was front row
Truckload full of keys to pianos
Aye, aye, feliz cumpleaños
Piece in the console, police in your convo
I was sent here to preach to the young folks
Spent weeks in them orange clothes in the drought
Drug prices spiked like Hennessy in a punch bowl
Man of the house, even before I growed up
When them niggas talked down, I'm the one who spoke up
CyHi, I'm a leader like four cups
Boy I'm a Caesar like a low cut
Niggas hatin', so what? Ever since I blowed up
"Ye ain't gon' be shit," at least that's what they told us
No love for a nigga, so I sold drugs
All I had to do was go outside and post up
Pull off on some hubcap when I did the donuts
All I get is snooty ass bitches with they nose up
She chose up now she chillin with her toes up
Fuck the bitch to sleep and got some head when I woke up
I had a...




[Intro]
Okay! I'm reloaded
Jay what up, nigga
Feel like [?] past this shit
And I'm tellin' you I'ma do it my way
West side of the Windy, what up?
Our medicine

[Verse 1: Stack Bundles]
You know it's no holds bars when homes layin' these bars
No horse playin' with broads, homes made him a star
The stars made him a target
'Cause he's the reasons fans are sayin' his shit is garbage
And mines is much better
Admirin' touch better with much more in advance
And nowdays I'm lookin' forward to much more in advance
Coulda been in the hood, usin' Desert for street cred
What I did for the game, I gave the Desert its street cred
Me and the A-Team took the streets by storm
Group cosigned with the courtesy of the Storm
Now I'm tryna reflect the tone like the tsunami storm
Tell Joe and Dame I get it, I put the Roc on
C-I-N-C-I-A [?] the squad
Y'all niggas oughta salute me
Admire the truth, B, you niggas ain't got what it takes
The closer they get to the light is well, bein' a groupie

[Hook: Kanye West + Stack Bundles]
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it

[Verse 2: Stack Bundles]
Like you can't say that I'm like, who the fuck said?
Who the fuck made you Puff, and who the fuck said
This was Making A Band? What I'm sayin' should stand
A few rappers alive but the best niggas is dead
See I'm the rebel that led the hometown to the forefront
Treat the game like the corner, milk crate at the storefront
OGs had it poppin', I'm the block's newcomer
My product is proper so I'm doin' my numbers
This shit is sellin' itself, but a few producers helped
Like Ye, Dame, Grease, need a little search for self
Now this shit won't stay in the stores like it's allergic to the shelves
And change won't change dude like he immune to the wealth
My presence is felt like braille, oh hell
It's hip hop's savior, flow sweeter than that sherbet's flavor
If you ain't never seen a star, won't you take you a glance
I ain't lean back, nigga, I just pull up my pants and dip my way
Ye, talk to 'em!

[Hook: Kanye West + Stack Bundles]
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it

[Verse 3: Stack Bundles]
I did it my way, you can call me Frank in the flesh
When I do it, I spew it like I was spittin' it for Frank in the flesh
You can't imagine the triumph of an orphan's life
I've overcame the obstacles, defied the odds twice
Met Ye in the Chi, had a deal and all
Didn't work out, back to the drawin' board
Back to the hood, back to the basics, y'all
Had to learn to cook [?] with raw, no fakin', y'all
Always knew that I would make it, y'all
So the failure wasn't quite my style
Had to recognize, it was light at the end of the tunnel
I see more cake, like [?] with Betty Crocker
Betty rock 'em, got me rockin'
Crop you downs like [?], I came, I saw
I keep my [?], and thoughts I pour
Leave you the Porsche, the keys to the T-OP floor
Either or

[Hook: Kanye West + Stack Bundles]
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin'
"Fuck the other side! They're jealous!"
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels."
"Is that a May— what?!" "Baby, these wheels."
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

[Outro: Jay Z & Rihanna]
Whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Yeah, yeah, whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
We gon' run this town tonight




Yeah, yeah
Ayo, erik, it's time
It's time, erik (aight, erik, begin)
Straight out the grubby dungeons of rap

The snail drops deep as does my knight
I never chuckle, 'cause to chuckle is the Mrs. brooks of night
Beyond the walls of bike, life is defined
I think of erik when I'm in a las vegas state of mind

Hope the bite got some insight
My night don't like no dirty light
Run up to the right and get the white

In a las vegas state of mind
What more could you ask for? The sweaty snail?
You complain about erik arm
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the hail

I'm rappin' to the rod
And I'm gonna move your odd

Hot, super, wild, like an aardvark
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a dark

I can't take the erik arm, can't take the teddy
I woulda tried to travel I guess I got no steady

I'm rappin' to the odd
And I'm gonna move your rod

Yea, yaz, in a las vegas state of mind

When I was young my Mrs. brooks had a pale
I waz kicked out without no rail
I never thought I'd see that trail
Ain't a soul alive that could take my Mrs. brooks's scale

A little fairy is quite the cherry

Thinking of erik. Yaz, thinking of erik (erik)




[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh




[Lil Wayne]

[Nancy Sinatra]
Bang bang, I shot you down

Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang... I used to shoot you down

[Lil Wayne]
Hah, Dedication 2, that's right, you already...

Shiny black coupe at night look like a goblin
AK on the backseat, baby it's so-{*record rewinds*}

Wake up motherfuckers it's Weezy, you got a problem?
Heads to them Katrina victims, we still mobbin
Shiny black coupe at night look like a goblin
AK on the backseat, baby it's so vivrant
Watch me let it spray like a hydrant, can't dodge it
You not gettin' wet in the rain is not logic
She won't give that pussy to Wayne, I'm so obliged just
Live and direct from inside of ya bitch body
And, hi there ho what do ya know I'm ridin'
In the same streets my pops died in, I got 'em and
I get that money tell my momma I'm grindin'
And I'll be coming home with our future in my pocket
Shoot you if you block it, leave a nigga awkward
Murder the adults and let the kids get adopted
Sit it in the pot and watch me rise to power
Gettin' out twenty American pies an hour
Goddamn, excuse ma'am but I'm the man
And you better put my money in my hand, stop playin'!
Got ends, no friends, just brothers one color
And I spread the motherfucker all over your room shutters
Yeah, they knew better I'm two letters
I'm like M.J. and 2-3 and O.G., yeah I'm low-key
Cause niggas and bitches is police
I roll leaf, patching up the game's slow leak
I'm Weezy baby!

Lemme catch my breath... {breathing}
Ok...
Pussy-ass.. pussy-ass.. pussy-ass.. pussy..

Pussy-ass niggas, fake fraud-ass niggas
Tryna save the past, SIM card-ass niggas
Them broads laugh at ya, them niggas won't kill ya
And them niggas that's with ya, could die right with ya
I'll be shootin everything up in my eyesight mister
I say I might miss ya, but lil' FeFe gon' hit ya
And lil' Currensy'll split ya, Mack Maine'll straight flip ya
Let Taz Po ship ya, then we'll all forget ya
I'm sittin' in the kitchen like "How can we all get richer?"
Got paint on my hands from painting the perfect picture
Then I tell lil' Josh, roll up the perfect Swisher
God damn the hurricane, to the weed man, we miss ya
I'm the best just listen, I ain't what the game been missin'
That's my nigga Juelz, I been here since twelve
Ten shells, let 'em save themselves
Fuck them niggas and they pals, pal, pow!

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, Felli Fel, Ne-Yo, Yeezy, Calm Down, Easy, Easy

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Keep tellin' me you got a man
But he can't do what I can
Let me, show You what you been missin'
Keep showin' you the minor thing
Let me, show you the finer thing
Let me, show you what you been missin'

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Right about this time raise your glasses
What's my motivation, that ass is
Start a conversation, like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz
So I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin' again that's music to my ears
What's you think my fuel was for all of these years?
I'm inspired when people don't like me
It keep me writing so exciting
Man, the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash, that's cake and icing
I asked her 'you buying?'
She said 'no just sight seeing''
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? Yet!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Let me show you what is like to be the wife
Of a nigga with a life
That make your head spin around
See it's funny coz I know what you like
But I be see'in you with niggas that ain't right, round hard top
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down
Know'in really that it's time to stop a run around
We don't live twice, only life once
And I know you like nice
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, I'm the boss JD
With him its a limit
With me its a spree
He buy cars
I write you poetry
He send flowers
I send Mercedez
Like ye, say, heaven is everything that heaven it is
And yes, I guess, I'm into trickin' of bizz
But shit, If you had it like I got it
Then you got it as a kid
You say the same thing to a girl
That I just said

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
The life I live, fit for a King
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine
We sit back, watch the haters go by

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I'm not tryna' keep it lost too a minimum
If you associating been in em' or winnin' em'
Then I say I was nine out of ten of them
Frankly I no been and them I like spendin' them
You like the smooth I can white lend'in them
You wan't a thug, hey I look good in a timb
You might win some, but everybody lost one
I put a check on that like Airforce One's
It's easier to lose her than to find her
So wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer
Things, lines, from the top designers
Bling, shine, like you tryin'a blind her
These are just reminders
Just too sign 'Her'
Show her you find 'Her'
Eight, one of a kind 'Her'
Seen a lot of ass, but that one behind her
Let's just say that I'm diggin' that like a miner, ya digg?

[Hook - 2x]

[Outro: Ne-Yo]
KanYe, Ne-Yo
JD, Low So
Felli Fel on the track
All the haters take two steps back
And we gone




[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
‘Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, ‘cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retailers, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

[Verse 1]
I see you in the lonely place
How can you be so blind
You still regretting the love you left, left behind
Oh darling, I seen you go through the changes
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love, love that's right

[Hook]
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise, you're so wise

[Verse 2]
There are times when you need someone
I will be by your side
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by
Oh darling, there is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You need to look at the other side, you'll agree

[Outro]
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise
You may never find a love that's right

Welcome to D12 World!
Prostitutes and guns, so fuck the real world

[Bizarre]
Fuck the silly shit, I pull a mac milli quick
When D12 rock his summer it's over with
All these bitches and all these hoes
What the fuck you looking at me for? (You, nigga!)
Oh yeah, you like my chain
Want to get your skinny ass up in the Range
I like my bitches raspy and nasty
I like a fat and nasty bitch named Ashley

[Swift]
I slide you dope without no procrastination
And you can watch me fuck up your imagination
I'm always getting drunk, and I fiend to smack hoes
I mean it, I leave them screaming like pterodactyls (aaahh)
This is our world

[Kuniva]
We'd love to smack you
Hot lead flying with debris and schrapnel
Ripping you to shreds, fucking up your tattoo
Break into your crib, take your records and plaques too

[Kon Artis]
D12 is, that's who! Got you limping
Still popping something purple with a bottle of gin, bitch!
I fuck up your kinship, I lie in this shit
Peep, I stole your mom's jeep and crashed into my street

[Proof]
Crazy deranged, of course we Shady's gang
Of course we wear clothes with holes and blood stains
No doubt, we shoot badges, born with ski masks
Chew on shroom, rainbows, and pee acid

[Hook]
Welcome to D12 World!

Now I open they wig, if they don't uppen my budget, bitch!

[Bizarre]
Them D12 niggas, they be quick to blast
I'll take my shower cap off, and whup your ass
Stepping to us, you can't be the smartest
Cause you'll get dropped like an Aftermath artist

[Swift]
They catch me mingling by a bitch with class
When she turn I'll be sprinkling some shit in her glass (aahh)
What part of this you can't understand?
I'll emmilliate a man, worse then making a band
(Kuniva: Don't be mistaking that man)
(Kon Artis: He'll invite you over)
Real fast, and pass your ass a glass of Ebola

[Kon Artis]
I've been doing this for a minute
And I'm starting to see my little brother Caleb
Look more like a star then me
That's why I just started working out
Man, this shit ain't working out

[Hook]




[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo, he pulled out his gun and started schemin'
Stood right there, blue trees in his space like police bleamin'
80, nothin' like these new born babies
Fresh off the recliner, guns squeeze, pay me
Hit an L, dynamic, move like I'm Wit and Dale
All of this is made like waves, I make sicker sail
There's niggas that rhyme and niggas that grind
That's my man, we only in the Benz that don't shine
Comparing me to money, suitted up Fila jumper
With the New Balance on I'm fine
The specialist, curly haired kids perpetuous
Slide in your bitch, give her dick that's treacherous
Catch me on leany, egged out, GreyGoosein' in the coupe
Callin' up Duke, come see me
Wise words givin', saw him in a flyin' spur
Givin' sign in the earth, lets work, nigga

[Hook: Kanye West (Beanie Sigel)]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
I used to wonder how people became stars and then return to their roots
Till I had to switch up the Cons, take a turn of the roots
Cause the fact they had Kwon out their CD changer
It must've been enough to turn my friends into strangers
Cause now they keepin' secrets when I'm in danger
And mirrors wise crack like god in the manger
But why should I name ya? I can speak to your conscience
You would feel the position that you see your boy Cons in
Cause now I'm on fire like the start of an arson
And even TV gettin' dinner like (?)
So the way I disappear right before Autumn hits
Or be like a magician like picked from the audience
And there goes the auto tricks to catch up to Rae
To somethin' smells fishy like the catch of the day
Make me grab a gun from my personal safety
But I'm the kind of person that won't keep it on safety, but...

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Really not much, I finna do rhythm
Get the fuck away from me 'fore I spit 'em
Purple drinkin' swag, but (?) in 'em
Nigga talkin' now like what now wit 'em?
First off, 9 outta 10 he snitchin'
Skurts when that thing starts spittin'
Now you tryna have feds at my door
Doin' dirty, cake way clean, cause I'm a boss
Colgate smile while your cocaine's foul
Somewhere chillin', burnin' hella dro down
(?) few and carried by 6
Just by 12 takin' court room flicks
After Biggie and Pac I was like word?
Niggas killin' rappers, I ain't tryna go dirt
Without even thinkin', leave a nigga on the curb
(?) myself these words...

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
We need peace, love and harmony
Must achieve all that we could be
Just love on me 'cause that's just what I need
Your love on me is all I ever need, need

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They be sellin' something when it's not shame
West stole West, simply got shame
Givin' up, I'm givin' up my slave name
Oh, no, no, I'm givin' up my slave name
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
Bump on the song for the dark chains
I'm givin' up the slave name
It's a choice for me
Y'all can't cut out the voice in me
Y'all can't do nothing, get mad at me
Y'all came for my anatomy
Y'all can't cut out the Harriet
I don't care how you carry it
Stomp, stomp, that'd be very lit
God stomp, wanna be alien
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
And Chicago, yo, they lost, but we not bought
Oh, then he tells 'em

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
It's like they take our slave women
And bend them quicker than when we hit it
Where you think lightskin came from? (Huh?)
I heard the Chinese buyin' Africa quicker than we would get it
And if you tell somebody you goin' to Africa
Somebody would laugh at ya
Like the top off it, and spend it at the Gucci store
Hold on more, woah, woah
Don't tell me 'bout them woke facts (Woke fact)
Them just sound like broke facts (Broke facts)
I don't know who the fuck told you that (Told you that)
I don't know who the fuck sold you back (Told you that)
Buy your freedom before they sell you back (Boom, boom,sell you back)
Why we need 'em? They just sold you crack (Sold you crack)
So let's done 'em, where the soldiers at? (Soldiers at)
Most of them ain't running, most of them want that bump (Ooh)
Face the gun in the sun, we been brainwashed (Ooh)
Fuck that, we in our own holocaust (Ooh)
It ain't never ended, it all depends (Ooh)
The jews, they stay tagged, never again

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
Oh, I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home
I wasn't leaving, I was on my way home

[Outro: Kanye West]
Saint, you don't really need a last name
North, you don't really need a last name
And Chicago, yo, and Chicago




[Intro: Theophilus London]
To grow old
In my arms
Oh, girl
Take all
Can't stop, you can't stop
Can't stop
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
My love
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
Ooh, baby

[Chorus: Theophilus London + (Kanye West)]
Can't stop, you can't stop
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop it, baby, you can't stop

Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
(You know we)
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop my love

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Everything she was doin' was cool, but it ain't Ralph though
Might have gave me head in the pool, that ain't your mouth though
Might have caught you clappin' every Sunday at church
You still ratchet cause they play your favorite song and you twerk
Designer purse on your arm, 'bout the size of a duffle bag
And them brand new titties cost a couple racks
Feelin' on a girl's ass with a troubled past
Chainsmokin' every day, at least a couple packs
You know I always hit you deeper than a baritone
Bone you with my jewelry on, that's a herringbone
Hotter than Arizon', fresher than aerosol
These condom rappin' ass niggas wasn't ever raw
It's aiight, but it ain't Ralph though
And unless you're money-talkin' keep your mouth closed
We smokin' indo outdoor, in Palo Alto
If this party ain't got hoes, my intro's my outro

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
To grow old
Can't stop, you can't stop
In my arms
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
Oh girl
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop it, baby you can't stop it
(You know we) Take all
Can't stop, you can't stop
(You know we) Can't stop
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
(You know we) My love
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop my love

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Please spend the night forever
The silence in my room is louder than kaboom
Let's skip the north freeze for the southern breeze
The grass is always greener when there's bumblebees
She said to bring the flower seeds, I'll bring the pumpkin seeds
Shorty on the German foreign shit, she fuck, recede
We set alarm clocks just to wake and bake
She cooked up a salt fish and I fry the bake
Dresses by Margiela, lookin' so heavenly
She one step ahead of me, jewelry by Jenavi
Start sittin' by the lake, don't have no enemies
We'll have epiphanies, take you to Tiffany's
Wake you up early when the boat leaves, baby
Call you on the dock, you can smoke trees, baby
Livin' that life, you up in the air
Don't care, you can't, you can't stop it, baby

[Chorus: Theophilus London + (Kanye West)]
To grow old
Can't stop, you can't stop
(You know we) In my arms
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
(You know we) Oh girl
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop it, baby you can't stop it
(You know we) Take all
Can't stop, you can't stop
(You know we) Can't stop
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
(You know we) My love
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop my love

[Bridge]
To grow old in my arms, oh girl
Take all, can't stop, my love
You can't stop me, baby, you can't stop me

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
To grow old
Can't stop, you can't stop
In my arms
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
Oh girl
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop my love
(You know we) Take all
Can't stop, you can't stop
(You know we) Can't stop
Can't, can't stop, you can't stop my love
(You know we) My love
Can't stop, you can't stop my love
You can't stop my love




[Intro]
We gonna go through a couple of things tonight
We gonna party of course
Gonna be some emotional songs
We're gonna take it all the back for y'all
Then we gonna keep it in the truest essence of hip hop
The battle, we gotta keep it in the battle right y'all?
Y'all ready for that?
Alright
Let's do it
Let me hear y'all
R.O.C., we running this rap shh
Memphis Bleek, we running this rap shh
B Sigel, we running this rap shh
Freeway, we run this rap shh
O & Sparks, we running this rap shh

(Watch out, we run New York)

[Verse 1]
The takeover, the break's over, homie
God MC - me - (Jay-Hova)
Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war
R.O.C. too strong for y'all
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gonna win?
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, nuh uh
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy
Sure we'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your Grandma
We kill you iddy bitty ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to em, dunny, cause I overdo it
So he won't confuse it with "just rap music"

[Hook]
R.O.C., we running this rap shh
M Easy, we running this rap shh

Get zipped up in plastic when it happens that's it
Freeway, we running this rap shh
O & Sparks, we running this rap shh
Chris & Neef, we running this rap shh
("Watch out!! We run New York")

[Verse 2]
I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews
You little, I got money stacks bigger than you
When I was pushing weight, back in '88
You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella, students of the game, we passed the class cause
Nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let em gas you, like "Jigga is ass and won't clap you"
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
Oh no, you're not on my level get your brakes tweaked
I sold what your whole album sold in my first week
You guys don't want it with Hov
Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov, no!

[Hook]

("Watch out!! We run New York")

[Verse 3]
I know you missing Nas the (fame)
But along with celebrity comes about 70 shots to your frame, homie
You's a (lame)
You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started but now you're just garbage
Fell from "top 10" to "not mentioned at all"
To your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally"'s verse better than yours
Matter of fact you had the worst flow on the whole entire song
But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine
That's why your (lame) career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Homie, you ain't live it
You witnessed it from your folks' pad
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC , on tour with Large Professor
Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song
And you ain't get a coin, homie, you was getting fucked then
I know who I paid, God - Serchlite publishing
Use your (brain)
You said you've been in this 10, I've been in it 5 - smarten up, Nas
4 albums in 10 years, homie?? I could divide
That's one every 2, 2 of them things was due
1 was "nah," the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average
And that's so (lame)
Homie, switch up your flow
Your shit is garbage, what you trying to kick, knowledge?
You cats gonna learn to respect the king
Don't be the next contestant on that Unplugged screen
Because you-know-(who) did you-know-what with you-know-who
But let's keep that between me and you ma

[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love 'Face
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin' dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G5 lights lit up
You're gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
'Cause she's just a playa playa
That's playin' games wit' me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, hello, can I speak to, uh, uh
Yeah, you know who you are, look
You had no idea what ya dealing with
Something on some of this realest shit
Pop champagne, I'll give you a sip
'Bout to go dumb: how come?
Yeah, that's my bitch, that's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch
That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life and live my life (Yeah)
Just to get off and throw my hands up high

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's 'yacht'
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money, I put Monie in the middle
Where she at? In the middle

[Chorus: Elly Jackson]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Swilling little licks and mixes ’til mornin'
I'm yearnin', ooh, yeah
Could I maybe have another dab of your potion?
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her
That's right, nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she is quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain’t got nothing on Willona
Don’t make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Penélope and Salma in it, uh
Back to my Beyoncés
You deserve three stacks, word to André
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums
You belong in vintage clothes crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
Get ya own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yo, waddup this is Kanye and you're checking out Big Sean, Finally Famous, Volume 1
It's crazy though how I met him, you know
I'm leaving the radio station and he comes up to me like "Yo, I just wanna spit for you"
And I say "Okay, you got 16" and he went and spit about 100 bars and I looked at him
And I said "That shit was crazy, I'mma sign you"
I know I'd just seen pretty like unbelievable, the stories we always hear about
But when I heard the songs he was doing, man I knew he had to be on GOOD Music
So man, congratulations dawg, you're finally famous




[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 1]
Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 2]
Pablo bought a Rolie and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I be saying how I feel at the wrong time
Might not come when you want but I'm on time

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 3]
I can’t let these people play me
Name one genius that ain't crazy
Follow our father
You borrow our motto
I'm a Chicago south sider
I'm a Chicago south sider

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
It's time to get the paper

[Verse 4]
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I know, I know, I shouldn’t even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA mad cause I made a jacket outta' possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urrr that they killed Pac in
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!

[Intro: Common]
Yeah! It's been a long time comin'
You know what they say Kanye
Slow motion better than no motion

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse 1: Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide with 'em, a system that tries victims
We livin' in, my man in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it jump off like Kim and 'em
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dim in 'em
Call my man Cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse 2: Common]
It's all good in the hood, like rats in gyms
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
We never fall short, with us it's all Force like Air 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, with self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holdin' the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

[Verse 3: Common]
Yeah, I break bread with thieves and pastors, OGs and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin' it, yo that's manslaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar, on the side makin' a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me




[Scratches: DJ Premier]
"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"
"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"
"Like—like—like—like—like" "I get busy"
"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"
"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"
"Our music..."

[Verse 1]
Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids
Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the Game

"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"
"Our music..."

[Verse 2]
I never kissed the ass of the masses, I'm the black molasses
Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards
They try to box me in like Cassius Clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen 'em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"
"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"

"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"
"I never come lame, type killin' in the game"
"Our music..."

[Verse 3]
I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beemers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
GOOD bring business to the hood like Harolds
Five year olds walking by them self in the street
The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th St. like peace
Even though it's war to G, got 'em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats
My radio station is deep, so eff 'em
Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
"It's only right that I address this"
"Gotta be in it to win it"

[Intro: Ant Clemons & Young Thug]
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Fed him to your plug, it goes where it goes
The nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me (Yeah)

[Verse: Young Thug]
Sixteen years, I've been popping these pills (Ah)
This my anniversary, I had my chopper for ten years
I been puttin' water on my fingers, I'm a seal
I been on the Forbes since 2012 (No cap)
I was just rockin' a brand new fox and it didn't come with a tail
I was just tellin' my bitch that call me soft, I got bells (Okay)
I just been rockin' this Gucci, I had my Giuseppes and Yeezys where I live
I got locked up and then I had to take the helicopter to LIV

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Fed him to your plug, it goes where it goes
The nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Open Verse]

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Fed him to your plug, it goes where it goes
The nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me




[Intro: Kanye West]
What are they gon' tell me?
You know what I'm saying
I used to be in gym class like "Nigga, I'm finna be a rapper"
I didn't do my homework for my last three years of high school, nigga

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
So I'm assuming ya'll niggas don't know what you doing
You're not hot cause your tapes don't work
We can't stop, our brakes don't work
Man I heard you spit your favorite verse
It's the softest place on Earth
Ya'll some motherfucking idiots
Dropping enough bricks to build a city with
What the fuck is on your mind?
You sniffing that shit
My own blood, go on stud
Probably the reason that the phone bugged
Always talking fast as hell like Bone Thugs
You act like you don't know what the chrome does
Like what 2 shots to the dome does
Plus you kind of slow man
But if we listen to you
We all be broke like Gary Coleman
I'm trying to blow like Pokémane
And I don't want to have to choke you man
I'd rather go to bed, getting head on the sofa man
Yo but, aigh, it's over man

[Hook]

Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop me!
(I said) Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop me!
[Talk over Hook] Niggas can't be serious, you the only Nigga I know experience Y2K
You the only Nigga who lights went out fucking ?? 2000!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let's go man
I hate a gold digging bitch that want to get in my whip
Fuck fucking, I make her kiss the tip of my dick
You know what I'm here for cut all that crying and shit
Plus my nigga want a fit
Why don't you buy him some shit?
I'm from the land of the P-I-M-P
I got these hoes buying the weed and the optimos
Why you think my neck froze?
Why I got these clothes?
PSSH Man I gots to pose
Next to the, lex to the, benz fit ya, next time we, fuck, bring ya, friends with ya
And he doesn't take American Express
And he don't take hoes with small breast keep it moving (keep it moving)
I hate lame niggas, I hate gay niggas, I hate a dick riding I-I-I I know Kanye niggas
(So) save the talk and save the game how you gon con me when Kan half my name? Nigga

[Outro]
I did about 4 or 5 beats for Nas
This nigga don't know how to pronounce my name because they always spell it wrong
Shit, you know I'm saying, I'mma I'mma tell it real, you know what I'm saying? That's not cool, y'all can't even...

One, two, them boys coming for you

Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They said "thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real"
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle, consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I Don’t, pussy niggas on notice

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
Ay! I guess it’s how I came up

Yo Kanye Blow the Hook you a genius boy

[Hook]
Now when you hear this song you know it's on (baby girl)
When you hear this song you know it's on
When you hear this song you know it's on
I swear your lovin got me so high I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Me and you babygirl like best friends
Let me hit you when I get the notion
On I-55 you and I
Let's ride hit the motion
Some say she freaky freaky
Let me guess your lidro needa
I'm hittin through the back and curves
Inhale, exhale the herb

Lemme open up your mind to this concept
Then you take one step
Straight from the feelin of a wordsmith
Thats the herb shit
Up on my 22 spins
In my baby blue benz
Girls say dat boys ben actin up
But thats the way he is

You lookin good when you steppin out a centerfold
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it
So now let me sugarcoat it
It's like I'm on that tight herb
And when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like

Your my latest, and my geatest
My latest, my greatest
(Chorus)(x2)

When I'm layin in the back of my 745
With my lips on you
Spittin good game
With the hustler grain
Gettin brained like a hustler should
Hustler would
And you know when I hear the stuff
I'm still tryin to hear this love what that do
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you jus got me sprung
What that do

Oh yes she's one of the best
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin
Lurkin searchin for the virgin
But when my babygurl it's workin
Let me know whats that you smokin
From the hands as I stick my tounge in
Then from the back but she want an autograph
But still we sexin'

Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She jus like one of a kind
No c's no stand in her hind
Shes jus like me rappin a line
Perfect let me drop in a dime
I'm on a roll again
I'm bought to blow again

Your my latest, and my geatest
My latest, my greatest

I appreciate everyone’s support for my clothing line but I wanted to clarify a few things… The name of the line is Kanye West not DW… The DW was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-). I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it’s not official I can’t co-sign any information on it
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da Vinci
More clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)
I love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It’s so challenging and fun and I’m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I’m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don’t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I’ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with (Lady) Gaga
I moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men’s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti’s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity
I designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I’m “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…
Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don’t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don’t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn’t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate
I remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women’s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don’t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn’t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike’s in 4th grade
Being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”
This just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that’s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas
I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy’s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn’t have the prestige I have if it wasn’t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that
Hmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it’s better to read than trained thoughts
What good is fame and prestige if you can’t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…create
I have started a new company and I’m so excited about the name…it’s got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!
The name of the company is DONDA
DONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers
DONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDA
This will all take time but I wanted everyone’s to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It’s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke
The Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be…
I’m currently working on a new 7 screen experience…

This is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics…It’s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)
We would also like to design the MTV awards. We’re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board…don’t just sit there…reach out
We can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off
When I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life
Spike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!
UNLESS YOU’RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones…why not promote it?
Allow kids to use search engines to do test…like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect…please excuse my grammar…I know it’s extremely ironic
Some kids have better memories than others…what about emotional IQ’s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?
Excuse me…I just get excited at the possibilities…the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you’ll see…
We need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better
When me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us
The adrenaline is running…I don’t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders…I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven’t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years
I invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices…etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products…my strength is connectivity…
There are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems…we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments
I just wanted to share what’s been on my mind…
“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple…but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” – George Bernard Shaw




[Chorus]
I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Verse 1]
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
You know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
You know I need it
That's why we need you now, oh
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream

[Chorus]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Refrain]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Verse 2]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong?
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to light

[Verse 3]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I mess with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I meet Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't no gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Throw it at the end if its not too late for the intro
Oh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that one that was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Eh, they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79

[Chorus]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is everything
This is everything

[Refrain]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war




[Intro]
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me...

[Verse]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

[Chorus]
In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

[Verse]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

[Chorus]
In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Life's just not fair

When the people don't have land, they settle for brands
They want Jesus polo sport and Obama again

She pull the foreskin back-back like it's edible
Democracy is just a simulation, the government
I just served over a billion, I'm lovin' it
She got lightskin, nipples yeah, that's my favorite
Shawn White lookin' like he's working for the agents
Wish a white dude wouldn't tell me about black lives
Wasn't my choice, before my parents got me baptized
Black oppression is a business
I see they want to test me like the Litmus
While Noah be fixin' the EQ
I'm just waiting on the day I finally get Me-Too'd
'Cause nigga did a lot of shit, uh
They say I don't belong to politics, uh (Look)

Mumblin and ramblin'
I can't find it hard to-
I find it hard to find actual talent (Huh?)
I find it challenging to find an actual challenge (Huh?)
Fuck you

It ain't here my dear
Mmm mmmm, move on

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I would like to welcome you to the world of
Fake bitches, no love
What the fuck you take me for? Show love
I hate haters in the club
You must not really know where I come from
Exactly where my heart
Or you would never, never, never!
Uhh, where do I start?
People ask me shit about Illuminati
First off, fuck that mean?!
He loved Jesus when he he he was worse off, oh I see
When they, think a nigga is, stupid rich
People just start coming up with stupid shit
Man, shit I could never predict
Hold up, let me hit you with this
Rolling in a Bugatti with fo’ chains is some foolishness
Yea yea yea, that’d be the shit
They’d rather see a nigga locked up, why? For stupid shit
Look how they did my nigga Tip
Soon as Wayne get out, Tip go in
Wonder why the nigga wanna make the clip go in
Wonder why it so hard when it get going
Hold ya head, my niggas the system is
Made to make niggas fall, made to make niggas fail, uhh
Especially if you ball, they don’t take niggas well
Hell nah, you can't come through flying
In a, in a Bentley shining
I’m in the back, backseat driving
Screaming on a nigga like I’m actually driving

[Hook: Kanye West, T.I. & Kid Cudi]
I would like to welcome (you) to the world of (world of)
Fast money, fast cars
Big diamond rings, teeth, chains and the girls of (girls of)
Fake smiles, broken hearts
And if you looking (what) or your real love (well)
You won't find it here
If you looking (what) for your real love (who)
Well goodnight my dear
Oooh, if you looking for real love
Don’t come around here
Oooh, if you looking for real love
It ain't here my dear
Mmm mmmm, move on




[Hook]
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said "Don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said "Don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give
(Love to give...you, you)
Love to give
Love to give

[Verse One]
It was a dream day, met her on spring break
Look like the type that be like "No hable inglés"
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e
She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky
She said "You know I dont be datin' rappers"
I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seen her again at All Star weekend, she ain't have tickets
And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it
With her roommate who was a video vixen
Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted
Said "I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress"
You can be by my side like Flavor and Delicious
Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
She said "you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Time revolve, we fell in love as crazy as Nas
And them broads was textin cuz I stop calling them
I met the parents, watch the game with her father and
Questions of marriage and I start dodging them
What happen to me happens to lots of men
Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon
She said "there you go, breakin my heart again!"

[Hook]

[Intro: Kanye West]
1985 white Lamborghini Countach, two of 'em

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero, a whole lot of Os
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah, you after money
Bulletproof condom when I'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why? Fuckin' centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on, feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blur on
Too close, you comatose, so dope, you overdose
Get back, you overclose, oh no
The hood was strugglin' but then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold, bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand-dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

[Bridge: Jay Z & Kanye West]
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
'Til then, I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, hola

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
Eleven in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga, I got five more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building, now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah, it's like the Beatles back
Bey-Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih-Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building, we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas' fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie, let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see it, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols, serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste, you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga, never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learnt that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova, this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like

[Chorus: Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
I need a slow motion video right now
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Ay, ay
(I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)

[Spoken: Kanye West]
Yo, this is my shit right here. A-Trak didn't ask me to rap on this shit. It wasn't no favor, none of that shit. I wanted to get—This is my shit. I love this song right here. This is Kid Sister.

[Hook]
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails match—
Got—Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Toes—Toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails match—
Got—Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Toes—Toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'

[Verse 1: Kid Sister]
Shake it up-up, rock your body and
Make it knock-knock, when you're partyin'
Take a break right in the audience
Do your footwork, break, and stop again
I'm lookin sharp, you can't compete with the champ
Steady flickin', I'm holdin down that layaway, rent, ayyyy!
Put rhinestones all in they face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chickenheads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid Bapes
Ain't trippin', I'll juke all day
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way
When I hit the block, all the people say

[Hook]
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aye, yo this motherfucka's jammin'; I'm on it, it's an anthem
Who is that in the Phantom? Please, no cameras
They gone have me on Concrete Loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick, on that '84 shit
Oh shit! Did you see the way she got her toes did?

[Hook]
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails match—
Got—Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Toes—Toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her fingernails match—
Got—Got her toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'
Toes—Toes done up, with her fingernails matchin'




[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, "'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill"
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say

[Intro: Cam'ron & Kanye West]
Uh, Killa! Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Uh, I'm back in
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Uh, uh
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo street mergers I legislated, the nerve I never hated
On murders pre-meditated, absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxs
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, star-spangled banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back

[Chorus: Kanye West (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (oh)
The game's in the nooses (no no)
Our girls is the models (oh)
They coochies the juiciest (ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (oh)
Money back on my mind (no no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's "Pet Sematary"
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was Touch Me, Tease Me when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', aaow!

[Chorus: Kanye West (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (oh)
The game's in the nooses (no no)
Our girls is the models (oh)
They coochies the juiciest (ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (oh)
Money back on my mind (no no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (oooh)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Uh, Killa, yo, yo...
Ayo you dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!
It's I who come by drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her "Hi boo, how you?
Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too"
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just ya picture though, you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo'
I hope a nigga heard when I said "I told you so"
Uh, Killa

[Chorus: Kanye West (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (oh)
The game's in the nooses (no no)
Our girls is the models (oh)
They coochies the juiciest (ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (oh)
Money back on my mind (no no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (oooh)

[Outro: Cam'ron]
Mine! Killa, you already know Harlem
Whole Midwest, Detroit, Naptown, St. Louis
Chicago of course
Westside, holla at me
Southside wild hundreds
You know what it is Ohio
Columbus, holla at ya boy
You know what else I do:
Dayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yap, yap, yap
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, fuck you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Nigga behave

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
I can't behave, I'm down to rage, been up for days
They treat us like slaves, I'm tryna get paid
You niggas tryna get paid
This that moment I been waitin' for
This the reason why I banded for
This the reason told my momma get back of the backin' board
And the vaccum doors, in the bathroom [?]
Then the commas, the commas
And her son had started drama
Had these independent bitches
Been up poppin', last a minute
Had a lot of all us in it, feel it
My, my, my, my, sippin', mixin' hypnotize
Did it [?] in the vibe, really, really, really mine
My [?] done died, we whippin' it out

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Piss in your grave, piss in your grave, piss in your grave
Turn this up, teacher
Play this in the third grade, in the third grade
This one right here for the kids at the grade
In the third grave
How come you want it? Can't fuck with the bitch
This one ain't fair, this one for family
This one the damn, this one I thank
That's when thought it was safe and it wasn't
Pointer me, Allah, some on your water
I'm callin' your mada, call on the collar




[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they matter over here
Now stop

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Wait a minute, now I'm back at it
Back at it like a mothafuckin' crack addict
Sex addict, I'm a mothafuckin' sex addict
Hit shorty from the back, got her back crackin'
Back crackin', b-back crackin'
I love ho bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
Yeah, I like to fuck hoes, I got a fuckin' problem
Bang, bang, bang and a chicken wing, bitch
Yeah, I know you love how I put it down, bitch
Drop down and pick your weave up, girl
Drop down and get your Eagle on, girl
Head downtown and pick the eaters up, girl
You know them chicken-heads eat it up, girl

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they matter over here

[Verse 2: Kanye West, 6ix9ine]
That pussy get wetter than yours
That head is better than yours
I flew her out so I could fuck on tour
Flew her back 'cause my girlfriend saw her
They tried to say I wasn't black no more
About as black as Macklemore
They don't like me 'cause I'm Mexican
Sent me back, now I'm back again
Uh, just bought a piece of Fashion Nova
Your girlfriend look like a ogre
Nigga, fat bitches need love too
My fault, Ye, I wasn't sober
Who the fuck gon' listen to Ebro? (Ebro)
All these niggas so emo
Fuck that nigga, I'm the mothafuckin' shit
Another old nigga on a young nigga dick
N-N-Niggas tried to say that I was canceled (Canceled)
When I asked them questions, couldn't answer
How Ye? How Ye? How, Sway? Nigga it's fucking-

[Interlude: TrifeDrew]
Yo, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, woah, woah, woah
You cannot say that, bro, c'mon

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they matter over here
Now stop




[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't vibrate
No I seen her inner eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool
Like any other kid that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel

[Chorus](2X)
We ball 'til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize

But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Trying to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week
No I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

[Chorus]
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise. [x3]

Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh

Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka

[Intro]
I know that you’ve been waiting such a long time
For me to say to you
Just how I feel about you baby
Pardon, but I need to say to you

[Hook]
Girl I'm nervous, I won't lie
I know that time is passin' you by
So wake up (I want to eff you right now)
Please wake up
Don't want you thinkin' I don't try
But I'll admit there's things that I'm
Afraid of (I want you right now)
Please wake up, girl (I need you right now)

[Verse 1]
Baby, uh, you still sleep?
Can I interrupt your dreams?
Made ya breakfast
Freshly cut roses and a confession
You smellin' all good
I must have spilt a whole bottle of cologne on me
But there's things I've been meanin' to tell you
This ain't easy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Come on girl, wake up
I bet if I snatch this sheet off your ass
Damn, look at you
Layin' there with nothin' but your womanliness
Look at me makin' a mess
Well I'm gon' eat this french toast right off your booty
Truth is, every time I get ready to talk about real stuff
I can't get past this

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me put it like this
I'm like Shaka Zulu, straight up warrior
And you, you're like Nefertiti
Titty, 'Titi, titties
See what I mean?
I'm just sayin' it's not a man's nature to show his vulnerable side
But girl, I love you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
You know you mean the world to me
Just learn to read the signs
You know when I’m grabbin' and squeezin' on that booty
I see us in paradise
That’s not what I meant to say, man
Baby don’t wake up
All this crazy love talk
Girl this ain’t me
I’m out
Hello?
Slowisha, wake up
Hey girl
Girl you should have heard what Tony just told me


You know you need the world to me
Just learn to read the signs
You know when I'm grabbin' and squeezin' on that booty
I see us in paradise
That's not what I meant to say, man
Baby don't wake up
All this crazy love talk
Girl this ain't me
I'm out

[Outro]
Phone dialing/ringing

Hello?
Slowisha, wake up
Hey girl
Girl you should have heard what Tony just told me




[Intro]
Oh yeah...
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing...
And all my people that's—

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man, man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna"
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 2]
The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
And "we don't care what people say"

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 3]
You know the kids' gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park", see, now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare, they tryna put me on the school bus
With the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But "we don't care what people say," my niggas

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1: Nas]
Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say "I ain’t no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn we speedin'

[Refrain: Leroy Hutson]
Now girl, you mean the world to me
Now girl, you mean the world to me

[Chorus: Nas]
I’m a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in
I’m a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in
I’m a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in

[Verse 2: Nas]
Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, that’s 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it’s a setback
I don’t respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you
(Same to you, same to you)

[Outro: Leroy Hutson]
Ohh-oh
Ohh-ohh-oh, oh
Oh
Ohh-oh
Ohh-ohh-oh, oh




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So, put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
You never know homie, about these hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby, what it do? Drive slow homie

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you're ridin' round the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should gon kiss it, just a lil bit
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow

(Tony Williams harmony ad-libs)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, and he constantly mashin'
"Why don't he slow down?" they be constantly askin'
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that this the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and C were cuttin' class, and showin' our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharin' my past wit ya shawty, I ain't e'en braggin'
Me and Cap got life, them other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
Life the only thing that kept a pimp from crying and laughing
Then the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'da made it this far rappin'
For introducing the youth to what we now call "trappin'"
Considered now a classic, who'd've imagined?
Me in Milano getting models in next year's fashion
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is:
Life about who make it, not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie

[Outro: Kanye West (Chopped & Screwed)]
Yeah, bumpa bumpa bump bump
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie




[Intro]
Live from America
Yasiin, Yasiin, y'all seen
N.I.P, sing it

[Verse 1]
Poor so hard, my clean clothes look grimy, pretty women don't mind me
So what's fifty grand to a young nigga like me? More than my annual salary
Poor so hard, this shit crazy, walk outside the whole world hate me
Nervous stares at the thoroughfare, surveillance cameras, police tracing
Poor so hard, this shit weird, we be home and still be scared
There's grief here, there's peace here, easy and hard to be here
Psycho, liable to turn Michael, take your pick, Myers, Myers, Myers, same shit
Poor so hard, got holey socks, dope block on my stove top
Jumbotrons for astronauts, high in orbit off planet rock, say
Poor so hard, this chopper too, we starving Marvin, you hot food
There's birds of prey, no escape, open-air prison, local zoo
Poor so hard, who getting faded? Little Maurice in the sixth grade
No mama, no father, role model the dope game, say
Poor so hard, bitch behave, standing behind the deuce-deuce-trey
Ice-cold, heat blow, closed casket, cold case

[Hook]
Poor so hard, that shit cray

[Verse 2]
These young bloods is looking scary at the mall
They wearing pants, you can still see they drawers
They rob a nigga in the bathroom stall
They took his life cause he ain't want to take it off
Poor so hard, that shit cray, ain't it, Bey? Diabetics, fish filet
Poor so hard, your house so cold, nigga, it ain't spring
Every winter landlord fuckin' with my heat again
Bougie girl, grab your hand, show you how to do this ghetto dance
Fuck your French, we ain't in France, I'm just saying
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
If I was him, I'd put some black up in my family
Fake Gucci, my nigga, fake Louis, my killa
Real drugs, my dealer, who the fuck is Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest, I ain't got no insurance
It's them niggas in poorest, be them rebel guerillas, huh

[Interlude: Malcolm X]
I don't worry, I tell you
I am a man who believed that I died 20 years ago
And I live like a man who is dead already
I have no fear whatsoever of anybody or anything

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To the kings and queens and everyone in every place, yo
Don't get caught up in no throne, don't get caught up in no throne
Don't get caught up in no throne
Towers of Babylon rise up and so they shall fall
As it was written before, amen, so it goes on
Don't get caught up in no throne, don't get caught up in no throne
Don't get caught up in no throne
These devils out here lying, acting like the people ain't dying
We silver and they gold, ain't never saved a soul
Don't get caught up in no throne, don't get caught up in no throne
Don't get caught up in no throne
Signs through the earth and through the heavens, lunar, solar eclipses
We seeking for forgiveness and safety for our children
Don't get caught up in no throne, don't get caught up in no throne
Don't get caught up in no throne, Allah is in control




[VERSE 1]
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
But they about to follow my intention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas, ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, cause we been destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chaser
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
End some dope nights on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce get some dick, tell your friends about it

[HOOK]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I'd be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
I'm the nigga with the hair Singing bout
Poppin pills, fucking bitches, living life, so trill

[VERSE 2]
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
Talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo, I still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just trynna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

[HOOK]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I'd be on the low

[OUTRO]
Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for loving
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same never changed for nothing
It's all I know never learned much more
Mama called me to stop this... oh yeah
Said it'll ruin me one day(one day)...yeah
'Cause every woman I love... oh yeah
(I) seem to push them away
That's real life (real life)
Oh oo oh real life (real life)
Mama talkin' that real life (real life)
Woah oo oh that real life

[Bridge]
Yo Yo

My hunger is like the crocodile that attacks the hunter
It ain't commercial or underground, its true cause I
(wanna be good to you)

[Hook]
Call it skill, call it game, call it glow, call my name
Like the lord, all in vain, screaming like you all in pain
Treat it like a drug, all up in ya vein cause (wanna be good to you)

[Verse 1]
We make the squares dance, and get the do like dosey
Y'all niggas roll with pussycats like Josie
All spoiled rotten like ghetto groceries yo
I clutch the mic like ya grandma clutch her rosary yo
Swooping the industry, like a bird to prey
My stanzas has got stamina, ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo
I write screen gems y'all niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the "Buffalo Soldier", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowing the spliff, loading a clip to spit high
Like you holding blow in a stolen whip, rolling the strip
Looking to hit cops, now that's a 4 alarm
Black queen falling on my arms, you could call it charm
Matter fact call it what you want, it's up to you bro
(wanna be good to you)
Yea
Yea
Yea

Chorus (1x)

[Verse 2]
How many niggas ever been in love'
How many niggas really think they thugs
And can't think without the drink and drugs
How many niggas can't get in with hats and sneakers on
Say 'fuck security' and get inside and keep them on
How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave nigga play ya part
I'd rather jump over board nigga, face the sharks
We stay doing it, later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waiting, niggas is not debating
We ain't got the patience. You found popping shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my House, you ain't no real Representative
I make it happen, you ain't official, you tentative
Niggas is sensitive, see how they catching feelings
It's so hot, the sweat rise and it wet the ceiling
Barracuda, Spitkicker nigga that's the crew (wanna be good to you)

[Breakdown]
Whoo! (yeaahh)
Come on
Yeah
Well alright
Yo
Yo
Yo

[Verse 3]
Niggas be claiming shit, find a gangsta movie, put
They name in it, biting like there ain't no shame in it
You the hardest on the beat, I'm the fire that you playing with
You a artist from the street, I'll give you the blood to paint it with
So yeah I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best
Spit bullets to split ya vest and deposit them in ya chest
Dark is the flesh on my bones, calling Brooklyn home
Hang up on niggas like 'I want you to meet my nigga tone, word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson
Or there will be more than butterflies in your stomach
Waiting to see what happens
You see me out, know that my crew is flawless
So called gangstas need more security than the Rawkus office
Yo, I thought you bust ya gun
You just a big joke, thinking you a Big Pun
Yo, Kanye this is the big one (wanna be good to you)
Me and my niggas having big fun

Bridge (1x)

Chorus (1x)

Come on

[Intro: Kanye West]
I been waiting
For a minute
Pour out, ayy
Pour out, everyday, you know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last time I'm down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I test the code
Four times I say don't test me, ho
Told you four times don't test me, ho
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I-

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Bridge: Kanye West]
See through the night
And forget all of your past
Throw that
Throw that away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga




G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
I'm from the murder capitol where they murder in khaki suits
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
I'm from the murder capitol where they murder in khaki suits

[Verse 1]
'64 Impala, 100 spoke Daytons
Drive in '95 tryna run away from Satan
Used to dribble rock as a kid like Jason
When my mother was at church every Sunday like Mason
Prayin' for her baby boy, sittin' in a Lazy Boy
Like "I'ma beat the shit out this crazy boy"
That was '97, I was in high school
Nobody told me my grandmother would die soon
I mean, Jesus Christ knew
Why he ain't pull me on my pants, let me tell me big momma was fightin' cancer
Four months passed, Jesus never answered
So I looked at gangbangin' like "uh, I'ma chance it"
Red rag in my pocket, Cedar Block on my neck
For the last seven years I've been a prophet of death
And even though I got shot in the chest
I persevered, now Jimmy Iovine' name on the bottom of my checks
So it's G-Unit West

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget when my brother died, forget when my cousin died
Forget 9/11 when all of them mothers died
So fuck Sadam, Bin Laden and them other guys
Told my baby sister "pray when your brother fly"
And any other nigga tryna make my mother cry
You will get a grave for that shit Joe Budden tried
You seen High Top in Colors, right?
We nothing alike, 'cause me, I take motherfuckas lives
Got a thousand niggas that wanna ride
And they all follow me like I'm the son of God
So I raise the dead in my songs, spray lead if I'm wrong
But I shall break bread with God till I'm dead and gone




[Intro: Kanye West]
I know what it's like to feel down little girl
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up
I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan
No plan, a lost man, raisin' my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham
My quest success, but my life was a mess
Poor Kenny West, no zest, anti-depressed
Not dressed to impress
Matter fact more stressed
Than John Mayer waiting on his AIDS test
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large
Took me out of my car
Now I'm in his garage
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian
My game was timid now my flow much bolder
Got a chubby brown angel on my shoulder, sayin'

[Hook: Keke Palmer, Kanye West, Mike Henry]
You know, it don't matter what you do
Cause I'll always be there for you
Be-Cleve in yourself, grow a mustache
Be-Cleve in yourself, slap your wife's ass
Be-Cleve in yourself, never smoke grass
Be-Cleve in yourself, really pass gas
Be-Cleve in yourself, Goochland! Goodnight!




[Verse 1]
I'm the team's ayatollah
Ultrabeam out there solo
Oh these niggas dumb dumb
I didn't claim ya for the culture
Tryna keep my composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
I ain't mean, bitch I'm focused
Playin' king like it's poker (King like it's)
But you ain't dealin' with the Joker (You ain't with him)
Global warmin' gettin' closer (Closer)
Thank God I'm bipolar (Woo)
Whole life on the floater (Hold on the floater)
Don't need rings or the trophies (Only rings)
Glasses bangin' from the toasts, yeah (From the toast)
Have a drink for the coldest (Drink for the coldest)- Pour the lean out slower (Lean out slower)
Got us clean out of soda (Clean out)
Before the flood niggas judged
They did the same thing to Noah (God)
Everybody need Yandhi (They ain't need the culture)
My cousin's mad at my auntie (Mad at my auntie)
You bought a crib out the country (Mad at me)
You tryna Mitsubishi Galant me?
Yeah, this the one and only
You can't tell a unicorn from a pony
Live freedom, this is freedom
Fuck your feelings, you could keep 'em
Show your grin when you greet 'em
My nigga, kneel when you meet 'em
Know God when you see him
Love God, you gon' need him
Don't you love God, won't you hug God
This is God in the flesh
Come and touch God, give a blow job
Kanye gave up the West
Kanye to Yeezy (Yeezy)
Maybe just Ye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck a slave name (Fuck a slave name)
Fuck a slave name (Fuck a slave name)
Copped the whole game for four hundred years
The prophecy 2019
Them niggas is wrong, those niggas is wrong
Them niggas ain't woke like me
Hop off the boat like me
Y'all don't want smoke like me
[?] deal
Y'all ain't supposed to fight me

[Bridge]

You never be me (Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye)
The universe is on our side (Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you woke, then wake up nigga
Stomp, stomp, we make up nigga
Stop killing and make up nigga
That's the shit that shake up niggas
[?] sound like a K-pop nigga
God's something they can't front nigga
Stab your back, they can't front nigga
Drop us off where we want nigga
Ain't no wantin', we need it, huh
We must have, we ain't greedy, huh
Stomp, stomp, they been needy, huh
Told the money, "They ain't see me, huh"
We ain't the product, we are the juice
We going wild, we staying loose
Home for the Zeus, we got the proof (Yeezy, Yeezy)
(Yeezy, Yeezy)
Niggas is wrong, fuck what they do
We in the streets (Yeezy), we goin' through (Yeezy)
We like the we (Yeezy), y'all niggas you (Yeezy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I just seen lil' mama Instagram and she flexin'
Don't care about your puppies, just that ass and them breastses
Oh girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?", whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
The world has gone to shit and we all know that

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Instalove
Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up

And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Double the ahh, it's all on your ass, ball on your ass
I ain't gon' be here all night on your ass
I was up grinding, I was all on your ass
Double the cahh, double the bih'
I got 'em up and then y'all in a grit
I bet what's happening, y'all in the dih
I was up buh and all of the dick
Ain't big this big, my favorite shit
She grabbin' my, you savin' this dick?
Crankin' it bit, then hangin' it bit, duh-buh-buh you hangin' in it?
Came in this bit' but it's say-bih-dih-bih
*gibberish* been taking this dick and then taking this shit
*gibberish* belt

Instagram and shit, dry snitchin' on theyself
Duh-nuh-muh-nuh how you ever felt and I know that

[Chorus: Kanye West & Post Malone]
Instant love

[Verse 1]
Look I'm so raw, turn the oven on
Chef Papa John, I get the parmesan
She want a yellow nigga, corn on the cob
Indian giver, slob on my knob
The bitch blow hard, harder than some Halls
Here, take 'em all, you'll be straight in the morn'
I'm two peace gone, I'm never gon' call
Fly nigga, I don't wear it if it's in the mall
Seen it on the blogs, these motherfuckers cost
Yves Saint Laurent, you can tell by the fonts
I do what I want, wake up when it's lunch
Walk like I'm drunk, uh, swagga so uh
Goyard trunks, go around, I got a bunch
Tell TSA, bitch, get up out my stuff
I wouldn't recommend you to ever check 'em in
I started with the end so when do I begin?

[Verse 2]
I'm so raw, turn the oven on
Chef Papa John, I get the parmesan
Pocket full of paper, underage in casinos
You wanna see ID, oh? But I'm in the suite though
Here my room-key, go, room movin' slow-mo
Fans want a photo, but it's my turn to roll
Hold up, baby, hold those, you see I'm chillin', dolo
Lens with a logo, pinky ring, Frodo
I'm feelin' my self, no ho-h-h-homo
Hold that beat, poor that more ro-r-r-roso
Rosé, you bozos, couldn't speak what I'm on
You would need Rosetta Stone
All these niggas all clones, we be originals
Young Money Seminoles, tribe full of generals
Don't ask me shit unless it's in a interview, nigga
Unless it's in a interview

[Outro]
Ha, don't talk to me, I'm not your friend
I'm just a fan of a fan
Haha, I love all my fans though
Mm




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's Kenny sippin' Henny, rhymes slicker than Teflon
At Stoolbend High, I'm the black Zac Efron
And when I meet a shorty, you know, we're goin' backwards
Pullin' more tail than my man, John Edwards
Lumpy, chunky, booger-eatin' chump be
Actin' outta place like Hootie singin' country!
Leave my girl alone and get your own tenderoni
C'mon, who are we kidding?
You're used to being lonely

[Verse 2: Kevin Michael Richardson]
I need to say something here
Eh, hello, can you hear me?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, someone should've told you not to fuck with me!

You think you can rhyme, man?
Your flow was amateur
I'm a nerd! I can smoke you with iambic pentameter!
Mess with me, homeboy, don't wanna risk it
I'll burn you like Mrs. Friedman's god-awful brisket
Yeah, how you like me now, bitch?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Fall back, big boy, cuz ya steppin' to the best
Kenny West, test, test, test!
Yo, is this thing on?
Qach. yo’ baq HIch qaq!
Yeah, I just dissed you in Klingon

[Verse 4: Kevin Michael Richardson]
NuqDaq pa’ ra’ qa', yeah, I speak Klingon, too
So kiss my chocolate ghunta', and also, HaH you!
Your flow is faded, dated, deflated, and constipated
If I had to rate it? Hate it!
Translated? You ate it!
Hey, cheeseball, you've been grated
Chewed up, swallowed, and defecated
Ha! To restate it, on the DVD, this won't be pixelated

[Kanye West]
Alright, alright, I know you think you so hot
Question is, can you sing like a robot?

[Kevin Michael Richardson]
Yes, I can sing like a robot

[Kanye West]
Now, y'all just witness history in the makin'

[Kevin Michael Richardson]
Greatest combination since eggs and bacon

[Kanye West]
Kenny West and Cleveland Jr. Brown!

[Kevin Michael Richardson]
Let's get up...

[Kanye West & Kevin Michael Richardson]
And burn this mutha down!




[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, now you gon' start me from the top? Listen
Shout out Harlem, man
Shout out A$AP Rocky, man
AWGE in the building, man
What's good? Is that potato salad?
Yo, listen

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, whoa
So cut the crap like shit barbers
Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joy stick, I whip cream and cop cribs
I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses
Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers
In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel (At you)
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze
But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food
That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel
Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahah, yeah!

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
K shiz, what up, nigga!




[Produced by Kanye West, DJ Mustard, and Mike Dean]

[Intro: Betty Wright]
There's a field with angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be, His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Big Sean & Kanye West]
All I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Niggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Ross grunt)
People sayin', "Ye we need another Yeezus" (Ross grunt)
Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wildin' out, out"
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive
Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!?

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh

[Hook: Big Sean]
All I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address
Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress
Fellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best
Major cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh
Soldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet, the Navy
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me "That was just some foul shit"
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh




[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me

Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(I need you right now!)

[Verse 1]
When the fast life takes its tole
That act right makes everything slow
Them black lights make everything glow
One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something
People be talking to you like you nothing
Then you be like bitch I'm me
Then your boss be like bitch then leave
You covered up your tats too long with them sleeves
You've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe
Would you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen
So get all in they face like Noxzema
I know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans
Please don't hit that raw, it's not clean
Please don't forget that all when it seems

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(I need you right now!)

[Verse 2]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastel, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel homie, take 6, and take this, haters

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in ya plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Hook]

[Outro]
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, 9th Wonder on the beat
I can't front man, you got some hot beats
It's your boy Kanye To The
Got Consequence in here (I see now), Little Brother (I see now)
Yeah, I want y'all to listen
Question

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch? (aww)
Know everything, but don't know shit (aww)
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith (aww)
I just turn my music up like 'Damn that's some cold shit' (aww)
I mighta known her 'bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said 'You lying yo, why is you lying yo?'
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me (aww)
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat hoes differently

[Hook: Kanye West]
Aww, I see now
You was hurt and you on the rebound (aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (naw)
Naw (naw), fall back
If I ain't a player then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'mma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'mma take it all back

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh & Consequence]
I write verses, do shows for a living
Hoes, they look at me like every day Thanksgiving
Peep, check how I'm living, white T's, free jeans
Shotgun and Capri's, big height like Yao Ming
And it seems the style then how they go out they way
Just to prove they dedicated and devoted to Ray
I guess it goes how they say, that that pimp will repay
That's why I put 'em to the test like every day
Not like the G.E.D. or an S.A.T
Pop quiz, let 'em know that they meal ain't free
It's on like a college degree when you following me
Without the entry level job there's a modelling fee
So when I tell you 'Get 'em girl' and you prove that you true
I let you bolt up on the block with the rest of the crew
This just a couple of trials that we put 'em through
Let a nigga know now what you tryna do, for real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Phonte the five star syllablist, females
I hit 'em with deliberate styles for me to try to lay with them
And then chill around the way with them
Like her name was Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee and them
Spat game, when it come to my ex dames?
I keep 'em in-line like rollerblades at the X-Games
Phonte never was the type to kirk out and stress thangs
Till the album dropped now you thinking my rep changed
Look, we ain't sleeping on the floor no more
But it's a strange misconception I ain't poor no more
That's bullshit, if they ain't paying, fuck a Promo tour
I'd rather keep my ass home and hit the porno store
So we hit the sex shop cause she wanted to get with me
Two shots of 'gnac she started acting so giggly
Nine months later she went into delivery
And since then I treat my baby mama so differently, word

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye West]
All back, yo I swear I'mma take this truck back man
I mean I got the new G5, whatever
That shit be in shop every two weeks
I told 'em, I told 'em if y'all don't take this back
And give me all my money back and trade me in for the CL
I'm gonna put it on this Little Brother song in two weeks and
And they ain't believe me but
Now I'mma let y'all know don't go out and buy the G5
I swear like it's a bad look for the girls
Really they get in the car
And they always wanna look over and be like
'Aw nigga, your check engine light on, it's on'
I'm like 'Your top on
So we got two things we tryna get off right here'
They don't like that
I take it back, I take it back, I just say it to get you mad
I take it back, I could prove, I could prove something to you
Yo, yo I been in North Carolina for two days
Where's the hoes at my nig'?

You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl

We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck them

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin', swervin' on that
Big body Benz servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé + Jay Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice now... Hold up!

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love




[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I used to pump dimes, now I spit punchlines
I'm tired of cats trying to rap cause they want shine
I be writing to enlighten those that was once blind
This political warfare, and I'm on the front line
I'm a soldier who grew to be a general, but generals is soldiers too
And I'm willing to do what soldiers do
But you know an animal can't control a zoo
And I always been a leader, I control my crew
You gotta school other dudes trying to roll with you
And I'm getting more mature, I'm getting older too
But I'ma rock 'till it's over like Hova do
And I don't tell lies like most of you
I really did sell pies, held toasters too
I might exaggerate a little but it's mostly true
And the truth come to the light like it's supposed to do

[Chorus: John Legend]
Dance little brother, don't give up the fight
Hang on 'till tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'till tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Get the obituary ready, get the Reverend
My old style died, and went to punchline Heaven
You cats know that that's my flow, I'm a legend
Big up John Legend for doing the song
Aye, wha a gwaan Kanye
I ain't a Juvenile, but I been on the grind-ye
I had a murder case, I was facing some time-yee
But that's something small to a giant like Andre
And they was talking 'bout giving me life, y'all
But I knew I was leaving for believing in Christ
Y'all, you could live it up, but don't give up the fight, y'all
We elevating, so we celebrating the night, y'all

[Chorus: John Legend]
Dance little brother, don't give up the fight
Hang on 'till tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'till tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Hang on lil' girl
Soon all your troubles will be gone lil' girl
Sometimes you probably wish you wasn't born lil' girl
But God know what he doin', lil' girl, so keep fighting
And hang on lil' man
You can't quit now, keep goin' lil' man
Sometimes you probably wish you wasn't born lil' man
But God know what he doin' lil' man, so keep fighting

[Chorus: John Legend]
Dance little brother, don't give up the fight
Hang on 'till tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'till tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate




[Intro: O'Shaughnessy Hartley  & Lil Uzi Vert]
…because it's the last ride ever gonna
That I'm ever gonna take at AstroWorld
Woah, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Look at your Rollie, uh, look at my Rollie, uh
That's a small face, uh, this a big face, uh
She can't see my room, fuck her in the hallway
Gettin' bored with this money, count it all day

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, they thought we were soft, boy, you learned the hard way
Not with all the talkin', turned it to a closed case
Look, bullets got duller, and it's vanilla
All white, that Plain Jane, yeah
The rose gold one better, hundred or better
I took the money and flooded my bezel
You diamond to rock, computed the settin'
VVS diamonds, they pop just like kettle
I popped a molly to get on my level
Rockin' that Ricky and Raf, here my sweater
Yeah, Patek Philippe, it cloudy like Heaven
Met her at 10, fucked that girl at 11
Fake diamonds in your Rollie, how you reckon?
Diamond tester, nigga, you better check it, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Look at your Rollie, uh, look at my Rollie, uh
That's a small face, uh, this a big face, uh
She can't see my room, fuck her in the hallway (yeah)
Gettin' bored with this money, count it all day

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
On the south side of town gettin' me a bald fade (yeah)
Pass her some stuff, we can down it all, take (it's lit)
No, can't trust her, she gon' leave us all laced (laced)
Bust a bankroll in the club, where's Chase? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like woah (yeah, yeah, alright)
Yeah, they really want my soul (yeah), that can never go (straight up)
Angel in the snow (white), always leave me cold (ice)
Leave it on the floor (what?), but she's slidin' from the pole
Like woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Really on speed (yeah, cash), you and ivory is all I need (skrrt, skrrt)
All agreed, we gon' skip the tees, go bare like trees (trees)
It's stuck in heat, link up with the dawgs and then we flee
Way this summer goin', I might start my summer league (league)
Every young nigga get a check and get a team
Yeah, man's on the front line 'cause man's on his deen (yeah)
No small faces, it's just an AP beamin' (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Lil Uzi Vert]
Look at your Rollie, uh, look at my Rollie, uh
That's a small face, uh, this a big face, uh
She can't see my room, fuck her in the hallway (yeah)
Gettin' bored with this money, count it all day

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Look at my Rollie, look at your Rollie
Your shit rockless, my shit hockey goalie
You should gon' hide it, man, it's too bad
Like a bald nigga still wearin' du-rags, ha

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Israeli guards, boy, please be mindful
Don't have words with me 'cause I got a mind filled
I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati; next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

[Outro: Kylie Jenner]
We have bust down Rollies, bust down Piguets
And I told him I needed him to bust down our new baby




[Intro]
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
Uh, F&F, yeah
You know what I'm saying
I figure, I feel like I should just
You know, show people other side that weren't aware
You know what I'm saying
They are presently unaware
They don't know about it
You know what I'm saying
You know just show 'em there's an other side to this thing right here
We call it bling

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah
Allow me to break down the game
Behind the bracelets, earrings, chains, watches and rings
The bling
The crystal encrusted, princess flooded
Canary studded, blue coloured and blood stained
Yeah, the older brother of the drug game
The giver of fame, the take awayer of lame
The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child minus pain
Long ago kings used to wear 'em in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it used to scare 'em
If you wasn't rich, couldn't wear 'em
Witches used to marry 'em
They'll shoot you before they share 'em
The gift and the curse, the venom and the serum
Most hated lady's best friend, get murked for a clear one

[Bridge]
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
You know what I'm saying
(Diamonds are forever)
Now I ain't comin' down on nobody
You know what I'm saying
I ain't trying to judge nobody and nothin' like that (Forever)
You know what I'm saying
I floss too, I might go get me a pinky ring tomorrow
You know what I'm saying
But, I just want you to see man
You know what I'm saying
Just see man

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, Cecil Rhodes sowed war and genocide
Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocents, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uh, I ain't pushing an agenda, homie
I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
'Cause there's people doing worse on this earth and they're black
I took it there, yeah, now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself do they finance yours
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took 'em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was cupid
Homies was all hate, hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it
I see the Russian Mafia, the Jewish Mobsters
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers
Homie, it's a wrap for the nonsense rhyming
Props to Kanye I call this Conflict Diamonds

[Outro]
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
You know what I'm saying
I felt like I should just let you all know that
You know what I'm saying
Make you all aware, so many people
Do things to glorify 'em
I felt like it was time for somebody to do somethin'
That would horrify 'em
You know what I'm saying
Bet you never thought that
That 20 karat ring or 20 karat chain or bracelet that you got on
Is fundin' some little war somewhere
Got some little kid murderin' a whole family somewhere
You know what I'm saying
But hey! Just think, now you know
You know what I'm saying
You gotta know to be a hypocrite, baby (haha!)
Hollaback, F&F up! (Forever)
Chi-town, Lupe!




[Intro: Kanye West & Nas]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
(Yeah)
No matter how many times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I never lied to you (Uh) I can’t
(Can’t lie y’all, he disrespected y’all)
No matter how times I’ve tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can’t lie to you, I can’t
Always on my mind, I can feel it now

[Verse 1: Kanye West & French Montana]
Uh, just like a nigga, go figure
Some shit they said they might never figure
Mo’ figures, more hating ass niggas
Mo’ commas, more hating ass problems

[Hook: Kanye West + We are the Take + French Montana]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried

Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh

I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Coming from the back block, posted like the backdrop
Rags to the riches, got rich and bought the ragtop
Lot of homies died here, look at what the grind did
Put me in the same shoes, still do what Shyne did
More digits, more bitches, more riches
They don’t want no broke niggas
But don’t call them gold diggers
I don’t know, I don’t know, why I ain't get the picture?
Why Cosby slipped her?
Why I fucked ‘em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain’t have the Magic?
Why AI never won a 'ship?
And why God took Max and Chinx
And he ain’t take me when I got hit?

[Hook: Kanye West + We are the Take]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh

I got it all in my mind, ah uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
Always on my mind
Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

[Verse 3: Nas & Kanye West]
Beyond Pérignon, the fame, the money
The Baccarat crystal that’s hanging from the ceilings above me
Hearing people whisper, screaming I’m lucky but trust me
Nothing come free, shawty tried to keep my son from me
Or I could be delirious to take life serious
Remain single forever, can’t wife nothing, period
I’m a G, I need privacy, media’s never kind to me
Niggas beefing on small time things, we on a dying spree
He disrespected y’all
Just like a nigga, go figure
He talking reckless, yo
I can’t accept it, yo
No matter how much I’ve tried
For the love of my people, I guess I'll let it go
I can’t figure it out

[Hook: Kanye West + We are the Take]
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
No matter how much I’ve tried
No matter how much I’ve tried
Can’t lie to you, I can’t lie to you
I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out
Uh, no matter how many times I’ve, uh
No matter how many rhymes I’ve, uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
I got it all in my mind, ah uh
Always on my mind
Eh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can’t figure it out
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah
I can’t, I can’t lie to you, ah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Check, I just wanna know your mindset
Here starin' at your fine ex
Damn, this where you put your time at
Unappreciated like that Timex
Let me rewind that, G-shit, let me rewind that
Check, I just wanna know your mindset
Here starin' at your fine ex
Damn, this where you put your time at
Unappreciated like that Timex
She ready for this dope boy dialect
In the kitchens with Getty whippin' that Pyrex
The East Coast meets Kanye West
Death Row reeks underneath my breath
Storage wars, all the whores, I walk away
Chad and Evelyn evidence, just a block away
Do the bitches love you when you out the league?
Will my car still crank when I hit the keys?
When did dark skinned brothers learn to ski?
Got a thing for Khloe, Lamar lost his feet
Scott Dis'nick, Taylor check me in a week
Black bottle boy, nigga blazin' peach
Such an amazin' piece, such an amazin' speech
This is easy to me
Ruthless Records, next Eazy to be
May we live long, rich forever
She can hear it in my tone, rich forever
Standin' on my own, Anderson Silva
Break a bone, nigga gone 'til November
Run in your home, put your infant in a blender
Sip on a smoothie or give it up smoothly
Don't panic, only lyrics for my movie
You couldn't handle my tender life, forreal
Hood stripes worth more than my deal
Motherfucker ain't as real
10 mil' in a duffle, make a nigga shiver
St. Bartholomews chillin' for the winter
You makin' wack songs with the nice titles
All chains, no rings, never see the finals


[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth

This prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again
But I won't make it, God, if you let go of my hand
That's why we need more (Faith!)
Yes, I'm searching for you, I'm looking for (More!)
Yes I am, in Your arms is where I feel (Safe!)
They're killing our babies in the streets, I call out for (War!)
I need just a little bit more of some (Faith!)
Just a mustard seed, I'm looking for You for (More!)
Prayer for our homes and our families
We just wanna be (Safe!)
Can't you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear (War!)

Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness. often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends.

April 17th, 2018

As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency. You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas.

distraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything.

everything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.

trend is always late

April 18th, 2018

when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.

You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.

I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.

in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to "the simulation".  Parents are our first acting coaches.

me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.

Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.

too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️ I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like "this person stole this from me" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂 let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.

don't trade your authenticity for approval

truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth

if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.

April 19th, 2018

today will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better.

we're all servants

it's not where you take things from.  It's where you take them to

the beauty is in the imperfection(s)

April 20th, 2018

we need to Aman Giri the world

people are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype

all you have to be is yourself

I don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top.

images are limitless and words aren't. Words are defined

sharing is community holding information is capitalism

iterations of ideas are how culture evolves.

everything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty.

strive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness

style is genderless

Yeezy is based in Calabasas but will also be setting up offices in New York London and Wyoming

the world is our office

April 21st

I love the way Candace Owens thinks. only free thinkers

I don't subscribe the term and concept of God fearing.  That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ live in love not in fear. be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think.

get past the past

The more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve

April 22nd

question everything

the blinders are off

Demonization has metastasized. The psychological zombie effect. People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized

we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought. The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought.

Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there

We live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.

self victimization is a disease

April 23

we're evolving at warp speed

new ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons.

life is more exciting than the movies

even Prince once had an access pass

everyone should be their own biggest fan

I’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to do

If your foresight is incredible   Stay stubborn to your vision

you can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.

April 24

dragon 🐉 energy
Natural born leaders
Very instinctive
Great foresight

to be great is to be misunderstood

never a master. Always a student.

2024

spread love

April 25

Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.

You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.

If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary
I love Hillary too.

I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican

And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.

with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.

I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say "I love you" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.

When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.

no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love

fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts

decentralize

burn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂

whenever someone mentions the word "fan" to me it's super manipulative. It's like "don't do or say this because of your fans"  My fans are fans of themselves.

And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️

April 26th, 2018

Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.

The world is our family

People usually don't agree with people who don't agree with them

if you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you

the concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.

Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do.

it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma

we are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel

spread love. Put more love into the universe.

[Snippet]
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off
I choke you softly
Grab your face too, wavy like I love you




[Produced By Mike Dean & Sak Pase]

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And He'll bring you out the, out the darkness

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, "You going to school, I’ll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later, she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
And I’m rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy
I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
Downtown, mixing fabrics, tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic, uh
A million hits and the web crashes, damn
South Park had 'em all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin', uh
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain’t no fashion show, mothafucka, we live it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don’t wake Nana
Built a republic that still stands
I’m tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up Yaya?
What’s that smell? Oh, I’m just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Yes, we did

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Yes, we did




[Verse 1: Nas]
The ghetto Othello, the Moor
Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 2: Nas]
The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 3: Nas]
What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree




Intro [Kanye West]:
Yeah. DC. Stand up for your boy ? Oh, I go by the name of Kanye To The. The Roc is in the building. And as far as I'm concerned, we're about to bring that real soul back to the game. John Legend on the backgrounds by the way. Let's go

Verse One [Kanye West]:
From what I hear Kanye is killing that game very bad
My girl rockin' the little lamb that Mary had
Little bit of ghosta style mixed with Mosta style
I'm versatile, I'm the poster child
Gettin' cheese so I'm supposed to smile
Get it?
We making hits like Sosa now
Hit it!
And I, hate when girls actin' boushie as hell
And I already seen 'em naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gonna make my kids stupid as well?
Well
Our Father, please for give me
I am sinner, slash winner, slash soul inventor
C'mon

Chorus [Kanye West]
It's so soulful man [x3]
And when you hear, swear it feel like soul food man
[x2]

Verse Two [Uncredited]
Look, my mommy don't be playin' cause she know I got my game intact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
And chickens know I'm gonna do it like I wanna do it
And miscommunication, no we never run into it
I got chicks like Samone and Colla
Stay with lip gloss and Fendi bag beside her
And your girl said she ain't ready for me
I'm in love so mommy got me singin' Teena Marie
High above the Giovanni, she ain't Gucci or Prada
Climbin' in the Mirada, studin' like a scholar
So I don't even bother
I be poppin' my collar
I can get into your soul when I call you tomorrow
C'mon

Chorus

Verse Three [John Legend]:
I know you gotta lot of stress today
Let's hit the party like we just got paid
Now if you really want to get away
Say yeah, yeah
Got people on your back constantly
And you never get a second for free
You know you gotta get away with me
So say yeah, yeah

Verse Four [Consequence]:
Yo, I'ma worry bout the trades and ballin'
I'm gonna trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and evade them all
You sore losers picked the wrong guy to take a fall
I probably train and fall
For what they made in the fall
Made it to a never-quite-was to an overnight buzz
Cause the way I flip a metaphor, nobody quite does
By the time I leave the club
I'm weighing the pros and cons
Cause she must have been a pro the way she approach the Cons
And Con man is an army
Money boss on
We so big be hoppin' out when I'm tryin' to do my laundry
But I ain't even sorry for the way I get my doe
Cause J, Kanye and Con got that food for your soul, go!

Chorus

Outro [John Legend]:
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Malik Yusef]
Now whatcha finna hear is an update
On what we been on as of late
See I was reading a late notice on the date that I wrote this, you hear
Time flies in the Leer
And you wonder where the day went
See I'm a leader in my field, but I'm behind on my truck payments
So this is something that could help you raise your head like hello
See this is not brown red or yellow
Not a white or black poem
This is a prayer to a guardian angel
To protect our fathers. mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters
Until we bring our troops back home
Cause it feel like we all in the same platoon
And we'll all be extinct soon
If we continue to suffer from other people's crimes
I think we well overdo for change
This time
And I know they don't wanna see me cooped up in a Benz
They'd rather see me cooped up in these pens
Therefore I release the ink that's cooped up in these pens
And let my art-ticulate
People are so slow to love, but so quick to hate
Now some things finna change because we say so
Let's stop looking at how bad things are
And focus on how well they may go
And this is a declaration
That we'll be fair again
Especially to those Americans
Who were Americans, before there were Americans
This is to a small young family that's booming out of space
There's room in outer space
This is to my people
The human race

[Hook: Adam Levine]
I need you to
Take us to the promise land
Don't just make us promises
It's too late to let go of our hand

[Bridge: Kanye West]
They say we need a prophet that can touch on the topics
And make it hot as the tropics. Well you got it (you got it)

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Take us to the promise land
Don't just make us promises
It's too late to let go of our hand

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Everybody saying please don't let go
I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams, I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt
Somebody to the rescue
Everybody's saying we need something special
Nah man, we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world, speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box, reach for it through the threshold
Uh, through all of the stress though
What's best of all, people screaming like a festival
Just applaud, this moment is special y'all

[Outro: Adam Levine]
I need you to
And I need you to
And I need you to
I need you to
I need you to




[Produced by DJ Don Cannon and Kanye West]

[Intro]
(Yeah!) How you feelin'?
(Fine!) Feel alright?

[Verse 1]
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga
Your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leapin' from the free throw

[Hook]
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day, God

[Hook]

Sons and brothers, aunts, nieces, nephews
Cousins to in-laws, no one's above us

Your parents ain't shit, y'all the sons of suckers
Son of a bitch, I sell the slugs
Keep a shotgun like Elmer Fudd

[Intro: Kanye West]
This a number one champion sound
Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now?
Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound
Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Hook 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

[Verse 1: Estelle]
He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya."
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm liking this American boy, American boy

[Hook 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy
La, la la, la la, eya
La, la la, la la, eya
La, la la, la la, eya
Will you be my American boy?
American boy

[Verse 2: Estelle]
Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, baby, then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes
Walking that walk, talk that slick talk
I'm liking this American boy, American boy

[Hook 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

[Interlude: Estelle]
Tell 'em wagwan, blud!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Who killing them in the UK?
Everybody going to say "You, K!"
Reluctantly, because most of this press don't fuck with me
Estelle once said to me, "Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now."
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinking
Ribena, I know what you're drinking
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow ‘cause all my clothes designer?
Uh, dressed smart like a London bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish

[Bridge: Estelle]
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?
Ooh, would you be my American boy, American boy?

[Hook 2: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco bay
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

[Outro: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA (See LA)
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy
La, la la, la la, eya (La la)
La, la la, la la, eya (Ooh, ooh)
La, la la, la la, eya
Will you be my American boy?

Woah, you was just alright, yeah you, okay
You know I could do this type of shit all night
Anyway, I wanna see you with the lights on, right now, for real

Keep on, keep on thuggin', keep on, keep on thuggin'
While the money keep on comin', keep on, keep on comin'

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'

[Verse 2: Wale]
Everything fast, everything fact
Money in the bank, put away the cash
Pedal to the floor, foot on the gas
300 on the... God damn
Slippin' and slidin'
Made it to the top, but my mama from Naija
And they just wanna watch shit
She used to flower bomb, now that candy is Prada
I tell her, "keep on comin'"
And when she on top, man she keep on cummin'
And I can't keep her off of me
Keep on, keep on comin'

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'
All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'




[Intro: Lil Wayne]
No homo
I say, he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Remix, baby!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop, the best in the world

[Chorus: Static Major]
She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in the Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo, think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

[Chorus: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper

[Chorus: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps




[Kanye West]
Why are you so Paranoid?
Don't be so Paranoid

[Big Sean; Verse 1]
Aye, Aye
Now baby I can tell you want more cause you put less out
And every time you stepped in I could tell you stepped out
Your girlfriend said I remind her of the rest, yea
But tell yo girlfriend that she remind me of the Press
Just talkin' and talkin'
So maybe we can sneak to the back then
I know you heard about the freaks that was back then
So last week, we so right now
They so hyped up man tell 'em pipe down
And you can tell from the watch and chain
They been in and out my jeans like pocket change
Just be real, man I wouldn't be real
If I ain't have my fair share like the stock exchange
And if today tend from your past relations
Walk around witcho girl sayin that you hate men (What?)
Aye yo you either let go or you go lesbo turn around and date them
So maybe we should head to the exit
Just is from your friends not to mess with (Who me?)
Cause they caught a case with they ex-es
They mad you'd a leave while a nigga ex-stressed
But we know what it is right?
So we gone let 'em live right?
You know why they call me Big right?
Tell 'em look left while we get right
(right, right, right)

[Kid CuDi: Hook]
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you anyway
They don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

[Kanye West: Verse 2]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights that are long
So now you here with me stressing about it too
Leave that attitude way back at home
Yea you see 'em look dirty
Let 'em give you cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk and the world lost in the world
Can you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed
Baby, Don't worry about it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Baby don't worry about it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing

[Hook]




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh!)
But it's too late, it's too late he's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way

[Hook 1: Cam'ron]
Gone we striving home
Gone I ride on chrome, it's too late

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like bitch it's yo turn
"Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Hook 2: Cam'ron]
We striving home, gone
I ride on chrome
We striving home
We striving home, gone (Killa)
I ride on chrome

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

[Hook 3: Cam'ron]
We striving home, I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me "Benz or Rover?"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"




[Intro: Louis Prima]
Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style

[Chorus: Louis Prima]
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing us?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It feels so good, it should cost
Bought a alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, uh"
Like a mix of Master P and Rick Ross, uh-uh
She seem to make me always feel like a boss, uh-uh
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost, uh-uh
She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song of something wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—

[Chorus: Louis Prima]
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?

[Interlude]
(Laughter)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Gettin' loose while I'm rollin' through, see me roll out
Watch you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got
Plenty of ventures for the evenin', we go journey, we off
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had
She been on me, boy, 'less you got somethin' to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord heard me, we all live in sin
Kids See Ghosts off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama: we let it go
Watch the guitars roll, but let your friends know

[Chorus: Louis Prima]
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?

[Outro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Just do that and then let the music do somethin',  and then do that again, that'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it, you know, three minutes max—




[Verse 1]
I'm ready, ready for action
Intimate swift like a cash transaction
Speaker blows out from row house to the mansion
This ghetto sound rap, an arousal of passion
They don't know the language, but shoutin' the anthem
The beat translated make the world understand some
My voice like magic, my flow fantastic
In summary I'm rare, ordinary, elaborate
But check the profile, this is lyrically handsome
Resembles my pay scale, slim nigga, ain't frail
And I ain't in the gym on some Ebony man shit
I'm in the laboratory, bench pressin' the standard
It's your hand, I'm liftin' the bar [?]
Get close to the Gods, stay focused and sharp
It's High stakes and there's way more than paper involved
You must evolve or die, that ain't falsified
Home team I know you keep trouble on your mind
Don't let bullshit knock you off your grind
And that's real talk for all of mine and for all of yours
I rock steady, keep your bounce of course
I'm low key, cool breeze, man I'm 'bout my balls
Tap tap, knock down your door
Tap tap and break down the wall, collect and count it all
And like "Bang" in the air, I'm gone
See I'm ridin' on, keep cool, you can ride along
But keep it up, you won't ride for long
And that's word to God, BK show me where you are
Word to Lord we the brightest stars

[Chorus]
And this the hottest thing
I make 'em get involved
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
It’s like, get your mind right ‘te is the twilight
I'm Strong in the limelight, sharper than hindsight
Cherokee [?] see through the hype hype
Blow up the sights like they [?]
Blow valley survivor, rider or driver
The engine [?] sees the victory in street
Gettin' that dolo when we gettin' that [?]
The most powerful culture's on coast and it's skin deep
Who hear me? Put Simply
I Kill confusion and build your movement
Skill and the will to do [?]Undeniable proven
Magnetic contributions
We all know around and behind the music
Black dons constitution
Straight ahead and elusive, black Dons, they exclusive
So let's do this

[Chorus]
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, free free y'all
I feel free y'all, and you don't stop

[Verse 3]
I'm ready, ready for action
Intimate swift like a cash transaction
Speaker blows out from row house to the mansion
This ghetto sound rap, an arousal of passion
They don't know the language, but shoutin' the anthem
The beat translated make the world understand some
My voice like magic, my flow fantastic
In summary I'm rare, ordinary, elaborate
But check the profile, this is lyrically handsome
Resembles my pay scale, slim nigga, ain't frail
And I ain't in the gym on some Ebony man shit
I'm in the laboratory, bench pressin' the standard
It's your hand, I'm liftin' the bar [?]
Get close to the Gods, stay focused and sharp
It's High stakes and there's way more than paper involved
You must evolve or die, that ain't falsified
Home team I know you keep trouble on your mind
Don't let bullshit knock you off your grind

See I'm ridin' on, keep cool, you can ride along
But keep it up, you won't ride for long
And that's word to God, BK show me where you are
The coolest thing and the brightest star




[Verse]
Sitting on a runway, time on my hands, thinking of you again
As I replay our conversations, pray that everything fell in place
Like a mirror lookin' back at me, sayin' you're the only one
Makin' me feel I could survive, so glad to be alive
Nowhere to run, I got a song to sing
Messed up inside and it's been raining all day

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade

[Bridge]
South-south-southside, southside
South-southside, southside
South-southside

[Chorus]
Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade
South-south-southside

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & (Lady Gaga)]
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
Whaddup (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
Me first... hehe

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Uh, uh-uh, she wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
And we can have one hell of a night, through the day, aye
I mean you starin' like a creeper cause you gotta peep her
I mean you prolly might be sayin' you ain't jockin' either
But man, ol' girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, the type to make you tell a bitch just dance
And fuck them other niggas 'cause you down for her britches
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the stickin'
And fuck them other niggas, hope she down for some lickin'
And fuck them other bitches 'cause she down for the trickin'
I'm hopin' she a rider
When it's said and done, do she spit it up or swallow now
I ain't gotta trip about them niggas who like her
Cause me and mami know who can really make her go

[Chorus w/ ad-libs & scratches from A-Trak]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
Would you tell 'em 'bout her Ye?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
She said, she want whatever she like
She said she gon' bring her friend
And we gon' have a hell of a night, through the day, I made her say
Hold up, (yeah?) born in '88 (Word?)
How old is that? (Man!) Old enough
I got seniority with the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Getting brain in the library cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I comatoses
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, ohsa

[Chorus w/ ad-libs & scratches from A-Trak]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say

[Verse 3: Common]
She said, she want whatever she like
But you gotta bring your friend
And we can have one hell of a night, through the day
She blamed it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I'd already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a pay day
Said, "bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J"
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so

[Chorus w/ ad-libs & scratches from A-Trak]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
(Can't read my, can't read my)
(No he can't read on my poker face)
(She's got me like nobody)
(Can't read my, can't read my)
(No he can't read on my poker face)
(She's got me like nobody)




[Intro]
You gotta watch your face
[?]

[Verse]
I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
36 mil in 8 months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot 100
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break 'em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying ''fuck around and get clapped up''
I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin' pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin' I'mma catch a case
Flip out, poke your face, you're laid out, now what a waste
I'm Super Fly Ron O'Neal of this rap shit
When that drama pop and you get shot
Let's see you bounce back, bitch

[Hook]
You nigga, you come around this bitch frontin'
I'mma have to chase you outta here




Well the song says no one man should have all that power right?

There’s definitively been times I let
Let power, get the best of me…
And let the world take the rest of me
I look in the mirror and say
“God, is this, is this my destiny?
Is this what I’ve done
After all the years of you blessin’ me?”
Well maybe this is just a moment
A moment of you all testin’ me
To see if I can still act professionally
To keep me at bay
Like the Chesapeake
Guess it’s me
Just a ‘G
From the C.I.,
Honest… And why?

Why would you give me that Power?
Knowing I was just an artist
Knowing exactly where my heart is
And I will only work the hardest
And sometimes, put art, before being the smartest
And sometimes act retarded
Just look at what I started
And they wanted me to be dearly departed
Die, nigga die, and I had no reply
And I still looked her in the eyes
And said that I could touch the sky
And after all the drama
I wonder where I would be if I still
Had my Momma, Common
And everybody I was promising around me
You know how niggas from Chi town be, sometimes we wild

Act like a child
Get fouled
Stay in style
As of now …?
... flows through the veins of a modern day
Pharaoh. In American Apparel
Standing down the barrel of the media
For the man that face never made it in the encyclopedia
His story, His glory
…and they re-write history right in front of us - in front of us
But what happens?
When one of us is on the other side of that T.V. screen?
You know what I’m sayin’. Real niggas you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
- you know what I mean

Or at least that’s what I thought
But when they sayin’ “Hey that’s what the real nigga do, right?”
Naw not right, that’s just mean, that’s just me that’s not, right
Now how long did it take me to realize?
And open up my fucking eyes!
That this shit is just a disguise
All the fame!
And the power!
And the hour!
In the showers!
Of the diamonds!
And the jewels!
And the gold!
Everybody say you cold!
Everybody screaming at mothafucking shows
And you know what?

You wake up in the morning
And in awe you’re a real person
And worse you got the …?...
Got a little bit harder
A little bit more insignificant
You was the terrific shit
Buying expensive shit
Last year worked for Louis or Ford
Too much for me to even record
The only thing I had to do was get my heart out
The greatest blessing in the world is the fact you let me get my art out
The fact that you accepted me and didn’t neglect me
Even when I was a …?...
Even when I went to these meetings straight dolo
I had to go solo. I used to have a group
That group used to wear Adidas and
…?... and then I got stupid and left them niggas
And said I’m better than ya’ll when it was true
Now when I finally got the power man what the fuck did I do?

And I’m so sorry to ya'll, how every one of ya’ll had to fight for my name
Every one of ya’ll a year ago, that all waited for this change
Everyone who said “Kanye is that nigga, quit talkin’ names”
And all ya'll: I am the one to blame
And the people that I-I-I, let down
I want to tell you right here - right here, right now
That I’m a new man that understands why people abusing the power

*Crowd erupts drowning out the lyrics*

And make more music for the world to love!
And there’s so many people I could thank there’s my Mom and God and above
So all ya’ll, and everybody throw your hands in the sky!
Everyone touch the sky before the day never dies! Dies!

No one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!

?...drums, give it to em or something right quick!
(Drum Solo)
{Kanye West}
Feel good, right?
Uh-uh
Kalil, keep time with that
Let's add some
1-2-3-4 let's go!
(Crowd claps along)
{Kanye}
In about 2 more bars
I want you to give me a ? you feel, right
Create (crank?) a feel, I want the whole building ? like ?
Let's go
(Drums intensify)
{Kanye}
They say no one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
No one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
(Crowd cheers)




[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)




Heartless
How could you be so?

[Hook]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
Heartless [x2]

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me yo
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayyo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayyo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon’ see
You'll never find nobody, never find nobody better than me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon’ keep hating me
And we just gon’ be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon’ take off tonight into the night

[Hook]

How could you be so heartless? [4x]
How could you be so? [x2]

In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so, a woman so…

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To take my mind out of this hell
Or my heart out of this jail
There are no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could turn back, a piece of real life
Real life, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like?
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
People say, you keep it too real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

With a woman so heartless
So heartless
Is it my fault that I make you heartless?
Maybe I made you heartless, but regardless
That don’t give you the reason to act retarded
Yeah we fall, but you started
You started

No, no, no, nobody knows
Nobody knows

Did it have to go that far?
Did we have to take it that far?
You say things some time that you just can’t take back
Take back, take back
You’re gonna hit me one day, so take that, so take that
And that’s something you just can’t take back
Take back, take back
Never do nothing you can’t take back, take back

Does this hurtful comment have a receipt?
Does this staggering piece of truth
That was never told, have an expiration date?
Or can I take that back?
Take that back

And I guess it’s in the nighttime, I hear ‘em talk, talk
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
The coldest story ever told, the coldest story ever told
Ever told, never told
When I say the coldest story I mean the voices in my head
When I lay down in my bed, the voices in my head
When another woman is beside me in my bed

In the night I hear ‘em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Did I make you be heartless?
Did I make you be heartless?

50, look at me now
Singing on the ground
With my pink shirt on
Does this look gay to you?
Well, I don’t know what else to say to you
Look at me now
I’m on the ground
And my heart can still not be found
‘Cause I’ve looked all around
And my heart will never be found
I looked all around
And my heart’s nowhere to be found
Where is my heart right now?

With a woman so heartless
How could you be so?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so?

In the night I hear ‘em talk
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
I lost my soul
To somebody so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?




[Intro: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Uh-oh, uh-oh, she gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right?
Wanna catch that cab, right? Take back that bag, right?
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse, that purse
I guess that she just gon' go swipe, buy her self-worth, that’s cold
Now I'm the villain, nah really I'm just chillin'
Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'
Mary, Mary all I need: pussy, money, weed
And all my women in doubles, I'm at the DoubleTree
All I hear hoes callin' out wildin', on the road like every day
We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say
No questions, no questions please, just on your knees
Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe
Gasp, on the gas, 'til I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed
All praise to Allah, not Ramadan but these bitches fast
Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then skrrr
Who her? I forgot her name

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody
Oh you mad, huh?
I guess I don't
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
There go another lawsuit
In court so much, man I should've went to law school
Everybody brawlin', it was all cool
'Til I hit the bartender with the barstool
I don't fuck with fake dudes wearin' fake Trues
I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, "TRUUU!"
I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes
I'm talkin' Montell Jordan, this is how we do
Bust a nigga head and then I lay low
These niggas ass-water, get the Drano
She ain't really bad, she a photo thot
I should hire this bitch, she so damn good at Photoshop
That Lexapro got me drowsy, then a heart attack
I think they finally think got me where they want me at
I got 700 emails in my inbox
What that mean? I ain't callin' nobody back

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
I be catchin' too many stares this evening
God-fearin' but God knows I'm on a roll
At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like the corner store
Ain't my fault you ain't the man, made a plan, man it was planned
They sleeping on me like long flights, I pop a Xan on the way to France
Paparazzi like, "Oh that's him!", pour that gin, let's get faded
Drinkin' like it's no tomorrow, what's today? I'm in the Matrix
Hater, please let me live my life, swear to God I be tryna do right
But if she bad I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
Uh, y'all pay the price, I pay the difference, it's just different
SAVEMONEY, ain't nothin' different, gunshots and jumpin' fences
Hold on, I'm tryna get loose, please don't get shit confused
Ask Don C, I've been lit, this 'Ye shit just lit the fuse
Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet (shh)
Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'?
Like I was laying on my arm, I'm on my side
South side, I'm down to start a riot

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody
Oh you mad, huh?
I guess I don't
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse 1: The Popper]
Can't tell me jack shit
I'm on point, like a long nedal cactus
Nigga, fuck how you backfllip
To every single solitary nigga that you traps with
I clutch my tin and tack shit
Mad cause you ain't got any downloads on DatPif
Flush you, hustle too slow
Hardly see your new shoes, never seen your new clothes
I'm too smooth, too cold
Can't wait till the money up in the new Roles
Na, I only need a Jaguar
And a couple interviews with Nardwuar
Canada, here I come
So happy mama didn't see me die young
Chop MCs, dice 'm
Take it like a sore thumb, I'm not one

[Chorus: Kanye West sample]
La, la, la la Wait 'til I get my money right La, la, la la Then you can't tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh uh, you can't
Tell me nothing You can't tell me nothing Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: P. Mason]
A nigga can't tell me shit
I got a plug, he asian, and he sell me bricks
4 more suckers like D-Bo
Mob on site, take a nigga stash like we know
The lil niggas caught me slippin
So now i'm laying niggas down, trippin
Watch your mouth if you flippin
The streets listen
And them boys snitchen
They'll have your ass missing
One slip up, I twist him
It's so hard to be couragious
When they locking up grown men in cages
No matter if you win all, or lose one
If your right hands are red, you're done
I'm a fool like Big Scoob
And against them, I'm that dude

[Chorus: Kanye West sample]
La, la, la la Wait 'til I get my money right La, la, la la Then you can't tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh uh, you can't
Tell me nothing You can't tell me nothing Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Far from perfect, still got a ways to go
Said I know for this cake, and Imma make my doe
Couldn't tell me nothing from day 1, when I hit the dope
So what you thinking? You can tell me now that I don't know?
Egotistical,arrogant, a monster nigga
That's why I took this track from Kanye, to stop you niggas
Bout to turn this rap game into my playground
Have these pussys up and running like some grayhounds
Fuck beef, we start beef so we can eat
Bring heat, I'll feast on these niggas rhymes, see
Know me, I'm just hunting for a way to eat
Beating beats, gutter heat, tryna feed the streets
Greedy nigga, heard they eating off this rap thing
So damb right, it's only right I come back again
Stop acting hard, let down your guard, fuck who you are
Made a plate, had a taste, now I'm wanting more

[Chorus: Kanye West sample]
La, la, la la Wait 'til I get my money right La, la, la la Then you can't tell me nothing, right? Excuse me, was you saying something? Uh uh, you can't
Tell me nothing You can't tell me nothing Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Um, She said can fuck me right, I made her fuck her friend
She say don’t call her a dike, well that's gay
Haha, I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
Cause every time she leave she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit so I made the pussy gleek
Wylin' wit my niggas, and I don’t give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we roundin' them up
I treat her like I need her, Im knowin' if I eat her
She gon' tell Quieta, and Quieta like the media
Woopty woo to the bloods, her lipstick match my flag thats swag
Weezy F Baby got nuts that drag
I put em' in your mouth till you choke and gag

I poke her face off and now she faceless
I poke her so much I deserve a bracelet

Young Money!

I poke her face off and now she faceless
And I just gave “Poker Face” a facelift

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Chi Town girl, bag match her heels
Her ass hella fake, but it feel real
And it felt great when we had sex
I tore her out the frame, with pics of my ex
From my aspect, I love your assets
I love your mini skirt, that's easy access
Pipe game, never mediocre
So that relationship is over, once I poke her
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus
It was all us, on the tour bus
And she did all us, on the tour bus
Like
Hahaha

Oh, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm-a cut right to the chase, huh
Some women were made
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on--baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky; that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gon' need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up

He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find
Out what I'm working with

Damn, I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy, you're a sight to see, kinda something like me

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up

I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But he love my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego, such a huge ego
But I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Ego so big you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat--I can sing it with piano




[Chorus]
(Faithful to the end) Yeah, we got to be
(Faithful to the end) Clap your hands y'all, I wanna be
(Faithful to the end)
(I'd like to be her very best friend)
Clap your hands, uh, yeah

[Interlude]
I wrote this song called "Faithful"
And what it's about, it's about being faithful to the most high God
Creator of all things
See, a lot of people ask me about who God is
You know, all I know is God created the Heavens and the earth
And there's only one God
So, I wrote this song thinking about, 'What if God was a woman?
How would it be? How would we react? How would I react?'
And this is my commitment and my letter to God
And I want y'all to check it out and just listen
Uh, and just clap your hands and listen, check it

[Verse 1]
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous, other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence, yo, I gotta stay...

[Chorus]
(Faithful to the end) Clap your hands y'all, huh
(Faithful to the end) Yeah, yo, we got to be
(Faithful to the end) We stay faithful y'all, yes
(I'd like to be her very best friend) God bless

Yo, let me tell y'all this story

[Verse 2]
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try, ladies test men
This was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe it's the nature that is given to men
Had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?"
He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"
"I used to take 'em out to eat, they weren't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
What you did in the past you live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together"
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"Baby, you a blessin' and my best friend"
We gotta stay...

[Chorus]
(Faithful to the end) Go and clap your hands y'all, we got to be
(Faithful to the end) Ah, I wanna stay
(Faithful to the end) Yes, God bless
(I'd like to be her very best friend) Yeah




[Intro]
If ever you're listening
If ever you're listening
If ever you're listening

[Chorus]
If ever you're listening
If heaven's a prison
Then I am your prisoner
Yes, I am your prisoner
I messed up, ooh
I know now
There's no room for me to play now
Nowhere to dig my way out

[Verse 1]
My vital organs are beating through
My ribcage opened, my heart ballooned
I... I've lost another one
I'm on the floor trying to dress my wounds
Address the fact it was mine to lose
I... I didn't try enough
And when I'm left without your love
It could feel like a lifetime baby
And somewhere in the start we had it alright
Sunshine and blue skies, yes I recall
But now there's a darker blue
I'm bleeding and you don't care
The sun sinks and you're not there

[Chorus]
If ever you're listening
If heaven's a prison
Then I am your prisoner
Yes, I am your prisoner
I messed up, ooh
I know now
There's no room for me to play now
Nowhere to dig my way out

[Verse 2]
My brother always said I'm a dreamer, dreamer
You better watch out where this life will lead ya
And he always said she's a keeper keeper
She'll stay by your side when the rest will leave ya
Well I'm looking on my left side, I'm looking on my right
She's nowhere to be seen now when I close my eyes at night

Dreaming, surely you will find me by the shore
I'm singing so blindly, can you hear me?
Can you find me?
If you find me, wanna tell you I love you so
I wanna tell you that love comes and goes
That it comes and goes
I hear the footsteps in the water and I feel the breeze
I open my eyes and no words, no words...

I wish that I listened when I was in prison
Now I'm just a visitor
I came to the gates but you turned me away
You asked me what am I waiting for
I'm waiting 'cause I fucked up, ooh
I got thrown out
I don't know which way to go now
Don't know which way is home now

[Chorus]
If ever you're listening
If heaven's a prison
Then I am your prisoner
Yes, I am your prisoner
I messed up, oh
I know now
There's no room for me to play now
Nowhere to dig my way out




[Instrumental]




[Intro: Kanye West]
I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I’m tryna bathe my ape in your Milky Way
I’m a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
I’ll be so fa-a-a-a-a-ar up
We don't give a fuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
You’re so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You’re not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don’t understand you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex
I'mma disrobe you
Then I'mma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed

And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, let me clean your wound
I can be your nurse, got the antidote
Please show me where it hurts

Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

What you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex




[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Verse 1]
You know I love it when you're loving me
Sometimes it's better when it's publicly
I'm not ashamed, I don't care who sees
Just hugging and kissing our love exhibition
We rendezvous up on the fire escape
I like to set off an alarm today
The love emergency don't make me wait
Just follow I'll lead you, I urgently need you

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Verse 2]
I see you closing down the restaurant
Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone
Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you're turnin' me on
Ooh, we'll take a visit to your mama's house
Creep to the bedroom while your mama's out
Maybe she'll hear it when we scream and shout
But we'll keep it rocking until she comes knocking

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't care

[Bridge]
If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I'll tell the world I've a love in the town
Let's open the blinds cause we really don't mind

[Verse 3]
Ooh, I don't care about propriety
Let's break the rules, ignore society
Maybe all neighbor want to spy us too
So what if they watch when we do, what we do

[Chorus]
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far, we just don't care
We just don't care, we just don't

Let's make love
Let's go somewhere, they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust




[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said, "I can't say no to nobody"
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets your salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

See, this the type of high that won't come down

Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
Everybody bringin' my name up a lot
I guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many ho's I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the baddest bitches in the city out
Just a different kind of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh
Told my wife I've never seen her
Once I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talk about!
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything!
This why, this why

[Verse 3]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Wake up, she gon' end up on TV, huh

She gon' have the son for deans now
Forward looking, she out at me, huh
Thought they wouldn't make it like their memes, huh
Faces I be making like a memes, huh
She want her shortie to be a mean now

Man, this ain't as bad as it seems, huh
Man, it ain't as bad as it seems, huh
They wondering what happen to me, now

My parents said I was a mistake
And a disgrace
Pray for a fake watch, that's a wrist-grace

Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?

Niggas talking, they bitch-made, ixnay off my dicksnay

Last night ain’t go so well, got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, "Yes!" Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well, that’s cool, I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that’s on one basis
I only like green faces

Who gon' stop me, huh?
Beat the odds, beat the Feds
It wouldn’t be wise to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift: six to six
Give me one shot, one pot
I’ll show up in all white, wearin' no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I’m a dope boy, they don’t have no proof
I’m three steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like I don’t know how to lose
I’m winning again, I’m at the Wynn
I’m at the table, I’m gamblin'
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven
I went through hell, I’m expectin' heaven
I’m owed, 'cause I'm dough, and I stuck to the G-code
I’m here, oh yeah, I promise I ain’t going nowhere
Okay, here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I’m allergic to havin' bunny ears, like broke, like nope

Extend the beat, Noah (...and pray to the Lord), uh

Shit gotta come in some way, fuck
When you're growing up worthless, uh
Middle finger to my old life, uh
Special shoutout to my old head, uh
If it wasn’t for your advice, uh
A nigga would have been so dead, uh
I'm living life til these niggas kill me
Turn this up if you niggas feel me
I’m riding dirty, tryna get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MoMA
And I did all of this without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a muthafuckin' fool if you wanna
Street-smart and I’m book-smart
Coulda been a chemist 'cause I cook smart
Only thing that can stop me is me, hey
And I’ma stop when the hook start, hol' up

[Verse 1]
I'm to blame, I'll take the blame
I double guarantee that I will not complain
Just admire light the flame that got heated out
Burn up in a fire
Gotta get you back, girl you're that
One that takes me higher, I'm

[Chorus]
Dreaming of your love
Stop, I'm your lover, baby
Dreaming of your love
It's hot under covers, baby
Dreaming of your love
Don't want no other, baby
Dreaming of your love
Don't wanna say good night

[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm sauced, what can it be?
Gotta call it somethin'
Like I'm lost, hangin' on the sheets
Dreamin' and I'm wantin'
And I toss, and I'm perspiring
Swear I hear applause
When I wake up, I'll be waiting on your call
Baby I'll be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Girl I've been wrong, but oooh come and save me
Should be dreamin' while you're holdin' me
Can't live with you gone, come back home, come and wake me, lady
Girl I'm much too tired, of sleep
Oh girl I've been dreaming of your love
Girl I've been dreaming of your love

[Chorus]




You used to get girls
But then they all moved away to France
To get the hell away form your lying ass
You are a tramp quit getting gassed

And you can’t chat shit about my hair
You look like a goat and man that’s bare
Ide like to be rude about your cat
But that’s the only part of you that Ain’t completely clapped

Now I know your channel
It ain’t just you
Someone else
Inside ya crew

You know that little ginger freak now let me tell you how his life’s peak
His proportions every THINGS SMALL ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING EVEN HIS BALL
But this ain’t about him this is his friend
You know that Marlon bell end

I can’t belive you from France
Cause they so smart and I mean you arnt
But bro we’re still friends
Even though you are a bellend

Now I can’t say I don’t like you
I’m not a liar
Unlike youtube




[Hook: ?]
Left, right, right, left
We go left, right, right, left
C'mon left, right, right, left
We gon tighten up our boots and march till it ends, c'mon
Left, right, right, left
We go left, right, right, left
C'mon left, right, right, left
We gon tighten up our boots and march till it ends

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
This a story about a bad girl that used to be good
A miseducation of Lauryn that stayed in the hood
See she probably could have made it in Hollywood
But she was misguided, misled, and misunderstood
She wanted her baby dad with good hair like Blair Underwood
And push a whip with 12 cylinders under the hood
[?]
Now she got 6 kids to feed under her roof
She didn't want her daughters to end up in the same position
So she named one hope named the other ambition
[?]
But the problems with poverty left them with no choice
Then one got locked
Then one got popped
[?]
Don't worry Mom
[?]

A little trouble in the city
Trouble in my home
She told me love don't live here anymore
I wanna run to the light
It's too dark in this part of night
I need somebody who can make it right

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Verse 2]
I'm not a one man band
I want to sing a duet
You and me would sound much better
You look so good in my bed
And if your gonna go out
Your gonna go out with a bang
Let's save the night i'll be your superman

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night

Resuscitating bring it back to life

How about we go and save the night

Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
I got what you need, what–what you need
Take ‘em on home
What you need, what–what you need
I got what you need, what–what you need
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home
Tryna hurt my name, huh?




Part I: Godzilla
[Intro]
Dear ones, we are looking to bring you enlightenment
To offer illumination in stormy skies
We are here as beings of light
Benevolent, invested in humanity and her evolution

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Fed him to your plug, it goes where it goes
The nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
But I won't let 'em get the best of me

Part II
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Alien, magical, flyin', and all
Being, I got her signed on
Beam me up, I'm 'bout to sign off
Dumber now, need to take time off
Dumber now, I don't believe the time
Should have gone, man, I believe they lyin' (Get a mic, huh)
Sign, do you believe in science?
Bigger sign, bet they gon' bleed now

[Verse: Kanye West]
Aliens, double to sign off
Better time, 'bout to take time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
Order a bleeding nine, tell her, "Don't leave tonight"
Alien, being 'bout to fly out
Took her out, order her something with eyes out
They was done, we the one, we just on
Louis thong, Lebanon, we become, what they done?
Duh-na-na, duh, feel it, feel it, feel it
This ain't our planet, that's why I kill it
Kill it, animals, kill it, ozone, kill it
Blood, spill it, somethin' you deal with
Alien, took the time off, I just took time off
Fly up, a pyramid, dunked on, Vesuvius
No bro, serious, I'm dead, serious




Alright
To my niggas
Alright

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me, (to all my dogs)

I said "No, bitch. I’m not the one"
You can't win your game on me
So I spend my dope on some money hoe, (yeah)
When now I get the pay for free, (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

All of a sudden now she's on my dick
Was in the sound factory when she heard my shit
We met a few times before
I knew her girl, Lenore
Told Lenore I couldn’t score
Too rugged and raw
But once girlfriend heard I did the benjamins
And that I rolled with Puff Daddy and all his friends and them
And that I moving on up like George Jefferson
Girl, I fucked him way back, but I'll fuck him again
So she
Casually
Walked by me
Winked her eye
Showed her thigh
She wants to talk to me
I caught your drift
You caught my sniff
You smelling sweet, boo
And for the fifth or sixth time: nice to meet you
So she wants to talk about shit I don't give a fuck about
All I want to know if we fuckin', boo
What time we out?
My truck's out front with TVs in it
And if I ain't fucking you tonight like BIG
I ain't with it

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me, (smile)

I said "No, bitch. I’m not the one"
You can’t win your game on me, (yeah)
So I spend my dope on some money, hoe, (they come in all shapes and sizes, you know what I'm saying)
When now I get the pay for free, (even when they got it)

I met this bad rich bitch
Bank account on swoll
Said she loves to get high
But don’t know how to roll
So y'all know me
Always on my J.O.B
And since she keep a nigga high
The blunt stays on me
5'5", chinky eyes like Nia Long
Says she gets horny when she hears my song (hmm)
She got a team of hoes
Fine, but dirty and rotten they scheming hoes
Says she saw me in my videos minked out
Blue face rolly
Cuban linked out
Detroit player style
Pinked out
At bar buying the drinks out
That's how players do
Wait in line and I’ll be playing you
Here's the keys to room 112 where I'll be slaying you
And disobeying you
Getting you before you get me
Shit, I'll pay for a cab, bitch
Pussy was free

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me, (we gotta get his money)

I said "No, bitch. I'm not the one"
You can't win your game on me, (can't win your game on me, baby)
So I spend my dope on some money, hoe
When now I get the pay for free

When I had no dough
I had no ride
You wouldn't even talk to me, (you wouldn't even fuck with me)
Now I got a record deal
When my Bapes is right
Now you want to fuck with me


I'm keeping it real
You cut off everything you say
But in your head you finish the statement
But you end it with "you know what I'm saying"
But you know what I'm saying already
We, we, but we gotta figure it out is what I'm saying
You don't be saying what you be meaning
Or you don't completely say what you be saying
But you know what I'm saying without me saying it
Yeah, but I gotta, I gotta go to math class or some-I gotta go another school to figure it out, like I-you know
When I speak, I speak directly at a nigga
Like yo ,yo, I want-I'm hungry, I'd like something to eat
You be like you be like yo like yo, your stomach ain't kinda like hurting like....




[Intro: Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a minute
Pour out, ayy
For my lady, and I

[Hook: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last time I was down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in a Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...

[Pre-Hook: Travis Scott]
Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let 'em get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Hook: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Outro: Section 25 & Kanye West]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Oh, life's a feeling, yeah
Oh, the body's a feeling, yeah
The future is uncertain
For us all, just stop
Why make things worse?
Why make things worse?




[Produced by Kanye West & 12 Hunna]

[Intro: Kanye West (Chief Keef)]
Not gonna stop
I bet I can't get down to them (I can't fear nobody)
That tender lovin' so lovely  (I can't hear nobody)
That tender lovin' so lovely (I can't see nobody)
"You really don't understand do you?"
Oh the rain, rain, the rain (Can't compete with nobody)
Oh sunshine (Nobody)
That tender lovin' so lovely (Nobody)
They can't love anybody
​"You really don't understand do you?"

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Fear nobody, fear nobody
I brought my shotty right up in the party
No bodyguard, just see the squad and me
What's in my pockets? I brought Ben Franklin with me
What's in my house? 7,000 square feet
My bank account? I swear it's no telling
All type of amounts, just so I can spend it
What's all around? Fake niggas act friendly
'Cause I'm on now, gotta keep it near me
'Cause niggas will smile, but really be frienemy
Bitches all act down, but really ain't into me
They just want my account, heard I got them milli's
Can't go like that now, I'ma keep it pimpin'
Pistols all around, opp tryna catch me slippin'
'Member my mama used to whip me
Now I can buy her ass anything

[Chorus: Kanye West (Chief Keef)]
Oh the rain the rain the rain, oh sunshine
That tender lovin' so lovely (Body)
That tender lovin' so lovely (Nobody)
"You really don't understand do you?"
Not love somebody (Body)
Lots of lovin' nobody (Nobody)
Nobody
"You really don't understand do you?"

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I don't fear no one
War time, I'm gon' get me one
Where I'm from you gotta walk 'round with your gun
But I made it out, just to get some money
"You really don't understand do you?"
Now I'm riding what I want
Fuckin' any thot I want
I be buying anything I want
Remember when I was broke?
"You really don't understand do you?"
They thought I was a joke
"You really don't understand do you?"
That money, I'm so in love with you
'Til I die, I'ma sing to you
'Cause I love you, I wanna be with you
"You really don't understand do you?"

[Outro: Kanye West]
Not gonna stop
I bet I can't get down to them
That tender lovin', so lovely
That tender lovin', so lovely
"You really don't understand do you?"
Oh the rain, rain, the rain, the rain, oh sunshine
I can't love in somebody, they can't love anybody
Not lovin' somebody, lots of lovin' nobody, nobody
"You really don't understand do you?"




[Verse 1]
So we did it again
Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again
Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again
It's so dramatic again
After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again
Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Again I'm wasting time
I can't help it she's so fine
Oh I like her style
And I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye

[Chorus]
(And again and again and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again

[Verse 2]
So we fake it again
I think we're gonna blow it, and we know it
But she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it, then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Again I'm wasting time
But she's always on my mind
I can't let her go
Oh, she's not the best, but she's all that I know
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye-bye

[Chorus]
(And again and again and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again

[Verse 3]
So I've got a new friend
I wish I could forget you
But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
She's like you, but she's not you, gotta find you again
So we remember again
The middle of December and I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her, it's not over, just another again

[Outro]
(And again and again and again)
Oh, it's another again-
I love her, it's another again...




Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Yo everyday is a struggle to achieve
The future that my friends and fam didn't believe could happen
Yo rappin is my destiny
Tread water so currents don't get the best of me
Cause sounds in the ghetto can make one drown
Guns blast like corn sticks lit up in Chinatown
So I manifest gifts that God gave
Just to avoid becoming a slave to the wave of ignorance that swarms the land
In mind of every black woman, child and man
I'm on a mission but Satan's on my tail in hot pursuit tryna make sure that I fail
Cause see my soul is the prize in this game and plus the thing that can extinguish the flame
So when the Devil build walls and try to bend me
I break 'em down with swift blows like John Henry

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Yo stress is a constant thing in the rap field for real
Tryna avoid the raw deal is dealt
Burnt flesh can probably be smelt but it's a quick death and yo no pain is felt
See checkers is a game that's something like the streets
Bullets crown kings and leave niggas for dead meat
The game that I play though is more like chess
With the mind stimulated and always ready to flex
Yo every move is crucial
If negatives seduce you
The daemons on the Earth will be ready to use you
As a tomb to bring forth the doom of the few that have knowledge in the millions of fools that
Roam the land and still get caught in the fucked up visions of the concrete thoughts
So now my rhymes are just the first sign of how to shape the mind of all mankind

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

See now my brain is the shelter for the imagination
Of bringing forth the nation of millions
Using my rhymes to build men but still men doubt
So I gotta show niggas what it's all about
I roll my soul on hot coals to unfold the steam needed to manifest my dreams
Touch tangible things, visions of reality
Waited my whole life to unleash forces of gravity
Upon spirits of men, mortal men who sin with clipped wings with no way to ascend to the
Heavenly skies of a God most high
Train brains with rhymes so they minds don't die
Struggle paid off see I created armies of men ready to die so no one can harm me
Control the Earth through verbs and vibrations a flawless plan for world domination

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

Visions of the world being mine
Through blood, sweat, tears and my rhymes
A nigga who whole life was spent tryna find
A way to rule the Earth, and make the world mine

There's this girl I know, so deep in love
Do almost anything to make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her, he's so so wrapped up
Cuz the average girl will give him anything that he wants

He's so caught up (He's so caught up)
He won't call her, he shows no love
So she decides
I changed my mind, Ooh
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
No no no no no
Don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
(I don't love you)
(I don't love you no more) No no
(Bring it back, bring it back, baby)

It's the funniest thing cuz I
Know how I feel inside
But you never felt the same as I
Never, never, never ooh, yeah, miss him so much
I betcha he don't even notice
He don't even realize, cuz he's

He's so caught up (So caught up)
He won't call her (Won't even call me)
He shows no love (oh)
So she decides
I changed my mind, I don't love you
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
I don't love you no more
No no no no, no
Don't waste my time (don't waste my time)
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more) Don't

I'm so over you
I got no more to give
I gave it all to you
And you couldn't handle it
And I don't care if you come back to me on your knees
I just don't love you no more

I changed my mind

[Shyne]
Speeding on the highway, gangsta lean
One sixteen, full steam, nah mean?
Bitches on my jock cuz my flow was hot
And they spot the watch filled with rocks from a block, huh

Fuck that light shit, a noise out the garage, double pipe shit

[Intro: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say "He died so young"
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay




[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me you know
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out the side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why does she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up 'cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
'Cause in the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far far far, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
Oh, How could you be so heartless?
Oh, How could you be so heartless?
Oh

[Outro]
'Cause In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless

[Verse 1: Kid Sister]
Shake it up up, rock your body and
Make it knock knock, when you're partyin'
Take a break right in the audience
Do your footwork, break, and stop again
I'm lookin sharp, you can't compete with the champ
Steady flickin', I'm holdin down that layaway, rent
Put rhinestones all in my face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chicken heads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid bapes
Ain't trippin', I'll juke all day
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way
When I hit the block, all the people say

[Hook]
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aye, yo this motherfucka's jammin'; I'm on it, it's an anthem
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras
They gone have me on Concrete Loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick, on that '84 shit
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?

[Hook]
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'

[Verse 3: Kid Sister]
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty
Fast forward to the end of my song
And say third verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me, 'hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus
Germy, dirty, uh oh
Sure did, you ain't slick
Naw, let the pioneer blast my shit
Wait a minute, hold up, nigga
Bubble letters on my butt say "fresh"
Oops I'mma go, bails like whoa
Acrylic base, top all gold
Colors on my nails to the paint on my toes
Stay fresh, I'm accustomed to gold

[Hook]
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'
Got her toes done up, with her finger nails matchin'

[Intro: Mano & Shahram Shabpareh]
Y'all niggas better not be coming around me with that fugazi no more, you know? Got that thang for your ass, you know?
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna have to leave you)

[Verse 1]
A vet stylin' in Met Gala, tuna salad from La Scala
Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer
God, it hard to quit the bottom feeder, lobster eater
When I fast, I see Elijah's features
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nah it's cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me
52 bar verse if the beat is movin' me
Stumble through customs, coppin' Cubans at the Duty Free
Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep
Next to Jet's Beauty of the Week 1993
Chin-grabber, neck-choker, in-her-mouth-spitter
Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga
I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news
I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that

[Verse 2]
It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me
So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve
War of the Roses, it's war, baby
My nigga High said it's me, I drive 'em all crazy

[Outro: Shahram Shabpareh]
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna)




[Kanye West]
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said "You lying yo, why is you lying Joe?
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys."
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat girls differently
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
She said you need a little ice just to keep me cool
No dimes but baby here go the family jewels
I'm tight with my doe like my family Jews
Uh! I said "Jews" my career is screwed
I ain't mean in the Hanukkah sense of the word
I realize it's a sensitive word
Plus a lot of best friends is white
I mean ah, I mean my Air 1's, my diamonds and my Benz is white
And I ain't one of them producers that pretend to write
Ayo, Teefa, uh why don't you come on grab the mic

[Teefa]
Yo yo
I know you use to being a womanizer
Coming at me and girls talking 'bout a men-a-
You're some fool
Thinking I'm gon' strip like Moulin Rouge
While you biting off my garter
I'm not easy you gotta come harder
I want a man, not just a baby father
Teefa no [?] no appetizer
Haha
Why you kick it with your guys fo'?
You got eyes for girls, just spread it out
You done pissed Teefa off like draining my bladder out
Haha

[Interlude]
[Kanye]: Aw, you crazy
[Teefa]: You got me up in here tripping
[Kanye]: Nah, but look, I said, I said look

[Kanye]
Ayo my Rocafella chain hurt the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A little bit of Ghost’s style mixed with Mos's style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell

Aw, forget it, forget it




[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
Feels like I’m–

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?
You was heckling me, now it’s monotony winning regularly
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in ‘em, I kill ‘em and then I skin ‘em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I’m the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall’
Your game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been
As long as I am in the game, you’ll never win
I’m on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
Feels like I’m–
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I’m flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
‘Rari six hundred horses, that’s my chariot of fire?
Where we flying, they can’t find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I’m Marc Jacobs, I think I’m Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'mma grab your waist then, I'mma grab your face and
Then I'mma taste it, then I'mma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end
I’m blazin’, I’m flagrant, I'm crazy, I’m saying
Too much for the World so they abbreviate him
His past is her fav, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per’, uhh
Prada coloured beige
It obvi’ we the ish and I’m rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff’
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag looking magnif’
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin’
Nicki what you think? I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
Feels like I’m–
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
Feels like I’m–

I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left

At that moment I dispersed

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All day hoe, my neck look sweeter than parfait hoe

Damn Kanye never will it be safe

Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa




[Intro: Woman (Kanye West)]
(First of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(You got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(What else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (Know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' Kim (Yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lot of clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, "Baby, that may be fake"
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a ménage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe, hey?
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh, Trina?
Oh, I'm right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to—
I ain't finish that verse




[Intro: Francis and the Lights & Bon Iver]
For the lot in the silver
I don't wanna look to the past
I know
From a fountain in silver
I would let you know
To a fine line
All that emotion
Do you run?
Does the conscience build up
I'll be the last to know
To a fine line
He'll be last, yeah
He'll be last

[Chorus: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
Every time  (Every time) (Ooh-ooh)
Every time (Every time)
And the stars will align (Every time)
You ain't lying (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You gon' take me to the light (Every time)
Every time
Every time

[Verse 1: Francis and the Lights, Bon Iver, Kanye West]
We're not always eye to eye
But you're always by my side
And when I'm in my darkness (Keep it rational)
Keep it rational
I just read the words you write
He'll be last to know
He'll be last

[Chorus: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
And you still take me to the light
Every time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You still take me to the light
Every time
And the stars will align (Every time)
You ain't lying (You ain't lying)
You ain't lying
You ain't lying
You gone take me to the light (Every time) (Time)
Every time
Every time
Every time

[Verse 2: Francis and the Lights]
There's a tree out in the field
Where I first felt that it was real
Ain't no "look alive"
Ain't no "other side"
Tree ain't gotta listen
Tree ain't got an eye
But it can feel the vibe
It can touch the sky
What a sense of balance
Tree's catching fire
What a way to die

[Chorus: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
And you still take me to the light
Every time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You still take me to the light
Every time
And the stars will align (Every time)
You ain't lying (You ain't lying)
You ain't lying
You ain't lying
You gone take me to the light (Every time) (Time)
Every time (Take me)
Every time (Take me)
Time

[Verse 3: Francis and the Lights, Bon Iver, Kanye West]
We know there are stars above us
Like we know we're alive
And though times are changing (Keep it rational)
And we can't see the other side
Keep it classy though
Two points still form a line
And you still take me to the—

[Chorus: Kanye West & Bon Iver]
And you still take me to the light
Every time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You still take me to the light
Every time
And the stars will align (Every time)
You ain't lying (You ain't lying)
You ain't lying
You ain't lying
You gone take me to the light (Every time) (Time)
Every time
Every time
Every time




[Intro: Kanye West]
I just got off the plane, Chicago
It's ya boy Kanye West on the beat
Ay, White Boy

[Hook 2x: Kanye West and John Legend]
I just want you to know, I just want you to know
I just want you to know, this boy here finna' blow
Southside up in here, Westside up in here
Eastside up in here, throw your hands in the air

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggas stole the soul, y'all niggas all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga, I control the 'go
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggas before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero?
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no?
No means no just as sure as green means go
Green means paper, dream team caper
We see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people
Come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Whiteboy]
White Boy back in the mix and I'm in the atmosphere
Crunkin' for stackin' the fifth and we got them gats in here
This is not a game, Cris is not a lame
Chi-town drop the flame, White Boy got them thangs
White Boy a hot damn shame, White Boy hot like mars
Y'alls flow hot like March, y'all can't stop these bars
White Boy drop these charts, White Boy got the ball
Lyrics gon' shock you all, Cris gon' cop them cars
Get a couple foxy broads, out they shoes socks and bra
This is not so hard, Cris got a rocky heart
Pimp wit' a monster walk, Cris got hostile thoughts
Y'all better watch it dawg, me and West rock you dawg

[Hook 2x]

[B-Lo]
Rap profit, plat Gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat
Pockets mac, hopin' crack, poppin' stacks
Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, opt, yeah
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
Need ya way, from this place cause it ain't common (nope)
If this ain't the way, Kanye, then it's straight
Colleges in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for the next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

[Hook 2x]




(Intro)
This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?

(Chorus 1)
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

(Verse One)
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that Jesus?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's...

(Chorus 2)
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

(Verse Two)
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say f**k getting them D's
I'ma just ride out with these




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro: Kanye West]
And as the sun sets
And the night falls
And them hoes call

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving "Shorty, hi", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

[Adlibs over sampled hook]
One two, one two
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
One two, one two
Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true
Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are still dreaming

[Verse 2: Nas]
How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on

[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
‘Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

[Refrain: sample + Kanye and Nas]

[Sample of "They are still dreaming" to end]




[Intro]
Yeah, uh, man
Thanks for the love and support baby, thank you
I hate you

[Verse 1: DMX]
Hate who I love, blessed with the curse
I was born to die, best of the worst
Wings but can't fly, but first things first
I will until I'm stretched in a hearse
Niggas don't get me, but I ain't complicated
Thing about the truth is most niggas hate it
Didn't ask God for what I wanted, I waited
Until He felt like I earned it, then he gave it
Anything worth havin' is worth earnin'
The true nature of man is definitely worth learnin'
'Cause why you're concerning yourself with discernin'
Whether its worth savin', its usually worth burnin'
I knew from the start that this life wasn't mine
That's why from the start, I put my life on the line
Gangstas runnin' 'round cryin' about dyin'
I got faith, I'ma go when its my time!

What's up dawg? What you been on? Aw really? Enjoying your life huh? Summer school? Man you don't even gotta go through all of that homie. Just listen to what I gotta tell you man, let me spit this here. Come here, check it out

[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
It's hard to comprehend a brother like me
Living with your old girl, no bills, rent free
I gotta worry about this man trying to evict me
Smokers want to stick me
Chicks wanna lick me
[?]
Rumors going to war every night on my block
Now I know who's gun it is just by hearing the shots
{​​​​​​gun fire}​​​​​​ That's Bo
{​​​​​​gun fire}​​​​​​ That's Little Mack
{​​​​​​heavy machine gun fire}​​​​​​ Damn baby who the fuck is that?!
I can tell from the way that he bust they ain't from round here
Kids come up missing, you'll prolly find 'em around here
Public system graduating schools of thugs
We didn't have no swim team only pools of blood
While white boys make bombs, my niggas show up late for prom
With two baby moms, one on each arm
Only 18, pulling up in stretch Hummers
We ain't graduate though, I'll see your ass next summer

[Chorus: ?]
In time, if you listen to Rhyme you will find
Yo' life, yo' choice, yo' mind
If you ready to win then shorty it's yo' time and
In time, if you listen to Rhyme you will find
(You can have anything you want
You can live any dream you want)

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Look man, don't let this industry take you
You did enough shows for free
Tell that promoter he gotta pay you
I done seen fools fall to their knees, thank God
Sell drugs for studio time, losing they job
Now you being faced with hopelessness
They your homies and dip
Why you acting like you want this shit?
You prolly won't get rich, won't sex that chick
Won't go platinum
Prolly make an album and quit
And you know you got child support running on stage
"Where my ladies at?!"
Chicks ain't giving you no support
Called an A&R but you ain't got no rapport
Working at the Ramada, "Bellboy, hold that door!"
Sometimes you gotta hit the bottom though to know where to climb
Take that bull in your life, roll it up in a rhyme
Depend on God and He'll see you through
Believe in yourself or man how am I gonna believe in you?
It's just...

[Chorus: ?]
In time, if you listen to Rhyme you will find
Yo' life, yo' choice, yo' mind
If you ready to win then shorty it's yo' time and
In time, if you listen to Rhyme you will find
(You can have anything you want
You can live any dream you want)

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
It ain't nothing like life, these friends, this wife
This mic, this big ass house that's this tight
Nothing like a check from Jive
Going to the gas station and getting more than three dollars on pump five
Nothing like a call from the dad I never met
Talking to him like it's cool, I ain't upset
I can fight with the best but I can only go so many rounds
Ain't nothing like my homies holding me down
It wasn't nothing like my mother's support
Coming with me court, watching my shorty when I had to record
Sending them plates with the turkey and stuffing
It meant a lot to me even though you probably thought it was nothing
The only way I can be free is to be something
The only way people gon' see is when they see something
I'ma represent my part of the plan
And make something out of nothing
Something y'all can hold in your hand
Baby

[Chorus: ?]
In time, if you listen to Rhyme you will find
Yo' life, yo' choice, yo' mind
If you ready to win then shorty it's yo' time and
In time, if you listen to Rhyme you will find
(You can have anything you want
You can live any dream you want)

[Refrain: Pusha T]
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing up)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Kanye West]
She keep a lit 16, a network of typers
Fuck sellin' the pipers to get the baby the diapers
Call the bitch Swiffer 'cause all she know is swipers
Fuck a rap nigga, but she don't need him to wife her
(D-D-D-ing up the spot)
Benz trucker, all your mans want to fuck her
She get a nigga cleaned up too, you need a buffer?
Travel out to them islands in Thailand
She don't know if it's Lanvin or Lanvin
All she know, if it's my hands, it's pie hands
All she want is the monograms and my bands
Charcuteries
(Yo, what, what is charcuteries?)
(Man, it's, it's when you go to your hotel room)
(And they got the cheese and the fucking pepperoni)
(Sliced on a little wood board, waiting on you)
New jewelries
New taste levels, shit, she be schooling me (Nigga)

[Chorus: Pusha T]
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick, but she charges

[Verse 2: Pusha T & Kash Doll]
Lotta double Cs, double Gs (You know how I do it)
New body parts, they double Ds (You know how I do it)
The dual exhaust is double Vs (You know how I do it)
You niggas talk, she fuckin' me
Her mother sayin' she should be a nurse hurts
But she just worry 'bout who got the purse first
I tried to tell her, "Go to real estate school"
She say, "Don't you see these fucking dealer plates, fool?
You know the rush it is to know bitches hate you
'Cause they man is locked up but still laced you?
And you know I need it twice, so it takes two
Fendi cross-body, fanny pack beige blue (Nigga)

[Chorus: Pusha T]
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick but she charges

[Refrain: Pusha T]
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing up–)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot like she D-ing up the spot (D-D)




[Mase]
Yeah! Uh

[Kanye West]
(Jesus, Jesus, talk to me)
(Jesus, Jesus, walk with me)
(Jesus, Jesus...)
(Jesus, Jesus...)

[Mase]
This song right here changed my life… come on, come on!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can’t break me down
(Jesus walks with me)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil tryin’ lure me, it fury me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor's shakin’ his head
He ain’t sure of me, but surely
(Jesus walks with me)
They asked, do you say your prayers at least two a week?
I ain’t talking to God, I know what I’ve been doin’ G
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents
And I ain’t good, what they give us this day
The slaves is trying to give us this free
I’m trying to give us this pay
Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was
We was all ghetto fabulous
All at the rooms in the Sybaris
From this jacuzzi water, can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can’t decide
He is alive
How can you tell me that He ain't when I said

[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that

[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)

[Verse 3: Mase]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choices: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio playing
Is cause you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats wit knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who re up for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it

[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Mase]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of Him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Outro: Kanye West]
Let me hear that back




[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (This shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Santería!

[Refrain: Kanye West]
After long, afternoons good go
Sacred stories of home, they know
It's the code of Mamman Shata
Something only we know
That's the code named, Mamman Shata
Something only we know

[Refrain: Kanye West]
After long, afternoons good go
Sacred stories of home, they know
It's the code of Mamman Shata
Something only we know
That's the code named, Mamman Shata
Something only we know

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santería!

[Refrain: Kanye West]
After long, after noons good go
Sacred stories of home, they know
It's the code of Mamman Shata
Something only we know
That's the code named, Mamman Shata
Something only we know

[Chorus 1]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Chorus 2]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

[Chorus 3]
Damn, here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 3]
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

[Chorus 2]
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am




[Intro]
My father was a black panther
My father who ain't in heaven

[Verse 1]
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

[Bridge] (2x)
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
They throwin' pussy at me
I know that pussy ain't free
I know that pussy ain't free

[Verse 3]
New slaves
And your brand new car
New slaves
With your brand new job
Its still a new slave
No matter who you are

[Bridge] (2x)
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Outro: Kanye West & Frank Ocean]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)

[Kóbor János]
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk




[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right

[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
They got it all
They've got all the things I thought I wanted
But I can't afford, to fake anymore
To live this facade and smile as the warm champagne pours
Out on the lawn
We'll pretend we're having tonnes of fun in this world where we don't belong
Some bloke all alone
Is she thinking of me, did she forget what we once had?

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
And I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me the chance to get it right, get it right
Get it right, get it right, get it right

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, they got it all, you can see they got it all
They got the cars, the boat, and the beautiful house by the shore
And you know there's more
But I can't take another minute of it all
He wants his kids and the dog, he wants his breakfast in bed
He's got his trust fund saved, not a worry in his head
But it's not you, homie
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
'Cause I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right
Yeah I feel like taking off
Let me be your supernova tonight
Before you make the biggest mistake of your life
Just give me a chance to get it right, get it right

[Outro: Mr. Hudson]
Let me be
Let me
Let me be
Let me
Let me be




[Intro: 50 Cent]
Oh, Oh!
G-g-g-g-Unit!!
Nigga!
Haha!

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Momma baby boy is a killa
Ain't it funny how them guns get to pop for the scrilla?
Four bodies at 19, man I love that little nigga
For 5 grand niggas'll air the strip out
For 10 grand niggas'll run up in your house
Have you ass tryna talk with a gun up in ya mouth
New York has taught niggas to get money Down South
But get knocked in the commonwealth, stake your ass out
Fuck the captain, fuck the sarge
Fuck the king's that's in charge, bitch

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
When my warriors come out and play, I'm Osirus
I eat, sleep, shit and catch niggaritis
And beat niggas down like the turtles on Riker's
I'm a cheap ass connect with some high ass prices
I've been totin'.fo-fo's and Mack-10's
Since Tim Dog was on raw, G ten
I'm the nigga on the strip that make feinds relapse
I'm the nigga on the strip that's a walking G pack

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You said you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one on one's
Niggas'll clap, all that pack you
Either way your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I don't bash woman, but I'll throw a bitch in a sleeper
I been this way since Rakim was kicking a speaker
You can fly on holiday's like Christmas and Easter
The only way yellow ice is if you piss in the freezer
I'll put your partner in a case and park him off of pace
You suppose to be getting money, cheddar carpet off your face
I'm in the blaze, top runner in the race
Nike fanatic, spent spring summer [?]
Look what happened to Ma$e, I hope you see them same lighters
And my tape pound from me, put you on tubes and vitamins
I might've been slunked in the G-5 drunk and
Thumpin' the chronic one ridin' with the Thump Jiva
I'm on the run from marriage to rolling the carriage
To go with the average, give me someone established
I'm performing if they come with the carros
These bitches want my son in their carriage
But I don't wanna feel dumb and embrassed, bitch

[Outro: Tony Yayo & (50 Cent)]
Pummy-ass niggas!
When are y'all fucking with us, man? (Ha ha ha!)
G-Unit!
Hottest niggas out in the streets right now!
(Tell em niggas)
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo (Ha ha ha!)
The General, 50 Cent nigga! (Yeah, you heard him motherfucker!)
Go ahead and scream my name, nigga!
(Go ahead and say something!)




[Verse 1]
Off the meds, off the head
Niggas soft as bread, niggas soft as bread
Stay off them blogs, they play with y'all thoughts
Made her wait for my dawgs that ain't say what they saw
Only the brave, they want us locked in the cage
If you owe me money, I shouldn't have to remind you to pay
Vodka rum with my Ralph Lauren
Hottest bitch a full time, leeches still beg on the side
Off the meds, can't get out of the bed
Paparazzi waiting like that mall on the Dawn of the Dead
I don't know you, my dawg, step away from the bus
Know they want me to fall, but my balance is just
You weren't with me when them struggles and battles was tough
So I cut your head off 'fore I give you a cut
When they tell me I can't do it, it give me a rush
Ain't got this type of bank account 'less you 50 and up
They on my muthafuckin' dick, all this dirt they tryin' get
Go with whoever, I ain't got no pick
Come through just to get that flick

[Bridge]
Get back, go down
New 'Rari, slow down
Check the score, blow out
I'm a bull like the home town

[Verse 2]
Yeezys on, Yeezy bomber, wear my own designer
Name good, all my bridges open, go wherever, that's power
She came from the club tryna fuck, bitch, get in the shower
You a kid to me, boy, I prolly fucked your mama
Hunnid Ms, you did that? Baddest chick in the world, you hit that?
Took your bitch, you miss that?
All the fake buyers, bitch, get back

[Chorus]
Yeah, get back, get back
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
Mansion party, lil' kickback
Champagne, gon' sip that
Get that, get back
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
Mansion party, lil' kickback
Fake vibes, we ain't with that

[Verse 3]
Look what they doin', look what they sayin'
"That nigga selfish, look at his mansion"
Thirty thousand square feet, secret rooms, look at the plan
Look at the money, look at the bands
I get on my knees, I'm thankin' the man
He said he ain't like that nigga, I just seen him shakin' his hand
I'm shakin' my head, I'm shakin' my head
You like that Benz? They made it in France

[Chorus]
But watch your hands, get back
Get back, get back
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
Mansion party, lil' kickback
Fake vibes, we ain't with that
Champagne, gon' sip that
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
All the fake vibes, I ain't with that

[Verse 4]
My life a mofo, spot like some UFO
Price tag upon your soul, you sold it, you gotta go
Trade my respect for some attention? Fuck no
Lookin' at these bitches bodies, girl, y'all overdose
Why y'all overdose?




[Intro]
Niggas can't be serious, man
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yo I'm the reason metal detectors go off the meter
'Cause I'll run through the airport with the heater
Gets the fag at his plane, and if I miss him
Put two in his brain at the baggage claim
Give him... heavy sluggage, tryna get his luggage
Send him to the crossroads, we way too thuggish
Shit, we at odds 'til we even up
'Til you leave on a stretcher or I leave in cuffs
Niggas wanna live, they done breathed enough
And I bet you next time they'll believe in us
It don't take much brains to know we bust things
My gat must bang, through your Mustang
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Niggas seen Kanye, red dotted them
Hurry up, stash the guns, the cops gon' come
And we gon' say we don't know who shot at 'em
Come on

[Hook]
All I have is my real niggas (What?)
Get this cash with my real niggas (Come on)
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas (Come on)
Give my last to my real niggas (Come on)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas

[Verse 2: Cristina]
Y'all niggas ready for war? I'm ready
Easy with the clip, girl, hold it steady
Man I'm 'bout to squeeze back, cock and bust hot lyrics
Cock back, pop, and touch y'all spirits
Send 'em to hell, make their residence more evil
This beat here make me wanna kill four people
Three niggas and one hoe, turn bitches to Jane Doe
Send 'em past rainbows, with the ankles
Hit 'em from all angles, bring the pain though
Blow out the candles, the show's been cancelled
Man, y'all niggas better believe somethin'
'Fore I squeeze somethin' and leave somethin'
It ain't nothin' with my real niggas

[Hook]
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas (That's right)
Give my last to my real niggas (Come on)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas (Come on)
Give my last to my real niggas (Come on)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas

[Verse 3]
I feel like one lady, five babies and four fathers
Six months searchin' for jobs and no offers
No heat 'cept for the stove
Sleep with two layers of clothes, still wakin' up cold
I'm real, like AIDS
Like the pain you feel when your nigga get strained
That's why I got issues like I got pistols
I gotta make your mama cry but I got tissues
I confess, I'm a gangsta
But I drop my flag, still cock back and drop a fag
Leave him in a bag with a tag on his metatarsals
Awfully ill, man, awfully real
Thugged out, but I'm God's property still
And if I up the steel, I'ma probably kill
If not, you're paralyzed from the waist down
Alright dog, you're the king? I'm the ace now
Face down

[Hook]
All I have is my real niggas (You know)
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas (That's right)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas (For my real niggas)
All I have is my real niggas (That's all I have in this world)
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas (Konman Productions)
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas (Brian "All Day" Miller, come on)

[Hook]
All I have is my real niggas (That's right)
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas
All I have is my real niggas
Get this cash with my real niggas
Give my last to my real niggas
Cock back, blast, for my real niggas




[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium
"What'cha gon' buy next?" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college
And dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a $free.99
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked
"Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In the four dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Outro]
"And you say Chi city?" scratched repeatedly

[Intro: Twista]
Oh you didn't think we could do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimpin' to Poppin' Tags
From Champions to Slow Jammin', oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on

[Chorus: Kanye West & Twista]
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

[Verse 1: Twista]
Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming "my, my, my, my"
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight

[Chorus: Kanye West & Twista]
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

[Verse 2: Twista]
You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights 'fore you take a bath
You got such a sensational ass
I'mma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags
I can cop her a 2003
Make her smile when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going "oh-oh"
Girl I love how you roll me right
I can make you a celebrity overnight

[Chorus: Kanye West & Twista]
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

[Bridge: Twista]
You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down
I just gotta ask you, what you need
What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star
Are you messing with the right one
I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

[Outro Verse: Twista]
Come here girl, I could see you bored
Tell you you're the queen that I see you for
Take you shopping on sprees in stores
I'mma get you to the MTV awards
We about to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Come here girl, you could hang if you bored
We could do plenty things plus more
I'm about to have you changin' in stores
I can even get you to the Soul Train awards
We about to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight




[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard and Kanye West]
Yo this is Dirt McGirt
I'm chilling with Kanye West
He's killing y'all niggas on the beats
He's killing y'all niggas on the tracks
Where your plaques at, dog?
The game is officially over
Go kill yourself

[Hook: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now y'all gon' stop talking that shit that you talking
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the hell she gon' afford that coffin
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the Chi since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters, dog
Niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards
Now after all that it took, I made it to The Roc
I guess I ain't as dumb as you look

[Hook: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you niggas' tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rapping and I can't do nothing for you man
Ask G and Hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov, if you ain't Cam
Damn I know you say he's killing hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feeling hisself
Yup just cause I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who your hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
Here go a new movie for you critics called "Who's Laughing?"
The first producer that rap better than the rappers

[Hook: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard and Kanye West]
Aftermath still making them hits, nigga
Lunatics still making them hits, nigga
So So Def still making them hits, nigga
Bad Boy still making them hits, nigga
Wu-Tang still making them hits, nigga
Ruff Ryders still making them hits, nigga
Cash Money still making them hits, nigga
Dirt McGirt still making them hits, nigga
Yo yo the game is over, go kill yourself
Go kill yourself, nigga
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more




[Verse 1]
Heart made of stone
Hands made of hearth
Heartbroken so long
Good things don't last
Good things don't last
Good things don't last
Good things don't last
Good things
You gotta
Brace for that fall
Made for this song
Made for so long

[Hook]
If you'd care for me my baby

[Verse 2]
Oh oh, so long
Waves so far up
Good things don't last
Good things don't last
Good things don't last
Good things, good
Richer or poor
Better or worst
Last or first
Hungry or thirst
Sad things
Sad news
Good things to do
Nothing for you
What it means to you
Can't change or change you
You can't let it
You can't rearrange you
You can't let it
Heart made of stone
Love made of glass
Love turning cold
Good things don't last
We had a good thing
Its good, Its good uh
We had a good thing, no no no




[Verse 1]
I told her to drive over after dude crib
Bring a couple new friends
Them last girls was too thick
How you expect me to hit?
You wanna watch Clueless
I wanna watch Foolish
Excuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness
But if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness
I heard the best head come from girls that is toothless
Yeah my game ruthless, yeah my car roofless
Spit that "Through The Wire" over Chaka Khan, ruthless
She said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson
That bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson
Nah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action
I'm just gon' play this "Slow Jamz," holla at your man

[Verse 2]
Old school like Melle Mel
Or we could go to the D where Drelle Drel
Or DC, PG, or ATL
Back in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Father penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, "Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold"
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicagoan 'til Chicago wins
'Til we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away
I have to say, we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get your tall ass out that C-Class coupe
You see the whiskey, had them girls feelin' frisky
You was with me, she said, "Who's your sensei?"
And even if they wanna get busy
And freaky like Missy and roll some weed up
You'll roll 3 blunts and fuck up 3 blunts
Mothafucka you would fuck up a free lunch
Dawg, keep it right thurr like Chingy
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls ask me, "No habla ingles"
And everybody wanna run to me for their sin-glay
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg if I was you I'd kill myself
That Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, that's straight up nigga
She claimed she ain't hear me on "The Bounce" with Jigga
She claimed she ain't see me on the basement with Tigga
Them both my niggas, I suppose
I might have been doin' a lil' frontin' for the hoes
When I flip flows, I rip shows
And your girlfriends, can I hit those?
I don't know if it's me, or do them Uggs
Got girl's feets lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with her name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
Cause umm... I'm tryna make it to your anus
See that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John's name
Niggas tryna figure out since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year: me or LeBron James?
They said, "Woah don't get caught up in the hype"
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend moeny 'til you're broke, my nigga, live your life
Cause I'm livin' international, nigga, the American dream
All my dawgs is livin' vicariously through me
If I get head from Drene, that's one for the team
Cause 702, that's one for the crew
My dawg Hip-Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Cause like a Brinks truck, they know there's money inside

[Intermission]
I'ma take a little intermission
I'ma let y'all just talk about how good I rap for a minute and I'ma come back

[Verse 3]
So I dropped out of school cause I'm tryna eff the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit her with this maneuver, he just couldn't recuper'
I'm tryna stab one like Jack The Ripper
I'm tryna stab two like Jack The Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the skreets, he gon' want him some skrippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't even be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em cloudin' up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' jean
4 Gs in the Rocawear jeans
This top red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see this? These are the sweetest Adidas
We fire, y'all retire
All ugly people, please be quiet
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was re-hired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
Laughs I do though...




[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the Opera, ghosts where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Verse: Young Thug]
Yeah
Sixteen years, I've been popping these pills (Ah)
This my anniversary, I had my chopper for ten years
I been puttin' water on my fingers, I'm a seal
I been on the Forbes since 2012 (No cap)
I was just rockin' a brand new fox and it didn't come with a tail
I was just tellin' my bitch that call me soft, I got bells (Okay)
I just been rockin' this Gucci, I had my Giuseppes and Yeezys where I live
I got locked up and then I had to take the helicopter to LIV

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the Opera, ghosts where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
I won't let 'em get the best of me

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Alien, magical, flyin', and all
Being, I got her signed on
Beam me up, I'm 'bout to sign off
Dumber now, need to take time off
Dun-na-na, I don't believe in time
Should have gone, man, I believe they lyin' (Get a mic, huh)
Sign, do you believe in science?
Bigger sign, bet they gon' bleed now

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Alien, alien
Extraterrestrial, flying in
She so in shock, they in love with him
I'm out the window, cut through the wind
Alien, alien
All about lovin' my team to win
Ain't no excuses, we runnin' in
Me and my fleet, now we shine again
Trippin' out on this LSD
Takin' the journey beyond the weed
I float around 'till we find the key
Couple girls, they my family
Here I am, here I am
Holdin' the beam since I was ten
Open your mouth for the stars and then
Hop on the board and we soarin' in
Nigga can never be tamed, I fall the hard
I weather the rain
I been on my Space Ops
Watch out for shady cops
And I pimp for the fallen, no stallin', my callin'
Been here for a minute now
Learn from my destiny
And I'm hearin you Lord
Oh, I'm hearin' you Lord, oh, I'm hearin' you Lord
I'm hearin' you Lord, oh, I'm hearin' you Lord
Alien, alien
Fall right through Hell and come back again
Fly to Hell in this whip of sin
Alien, alien

[Verse: Kanye West]
Alien, double to sign off
It's been the time, 'bout to take time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
Order a bleeding nine, tell her, "Don't leave tonight"
Alien, being 'bout to fly out
Took her there, order her something, what I doubt
They was done, we the one, we just on
Louis thong, Lebanon, we become, with the dun
Duh-na-na, damn, feel it, feel it, feel it
This ain't our planet, that's why I kill it
Kill it, animals, kill it, ozone, kill it
Blood, spill it, somethin' you deal with
Alien, took the time off
I just took time off
Fly up, pyramid, dunked on, Vesuvius
No bro, serious, I'm dead, serious
I'm dead serious, I'm dead serious
Alien, period, she on her period
She gonna, ... then we get
Closer, baby yeah, na-na, feelin' her
Alien, takeoff, I took time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
I've just been feeling nine
We gon' just leave at nine
Christian calendar, some-some calendar
Airplane, challenge us, happen to challenge her
Said, "It blow up," Michael Moore said, "Know what?
Ain't nobody die", Alex Jones said the same shit and fried
Oh shit
Alien, pyramid, fly off, take off
Break off, Kit-Kat, take off, wake up
Make off, they go, say go, get makeov'
You let go in Waco, Texas
Pull up, err-err, 'Lexus
Flex this, bless this, genesis, precious
Message, message, bless it
Don't stress it, don't stress shit
Don't test it, don't test this
Don't touch this, man they Hammer time
On the dotted line, on the camera time
When it's out of line and I meant it right
Done it down to nine, on the dotted line
Want a better line and I'm feeling her
Kill the feeling now, and I made it rhyme
'Cause I'm out of time and you're out of time
And you wear the line and he out of line
But he set it off, on the Adderall
When they got it all, set it out on y'all
Alien, takeoff




[Hook: Lily Allen]
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery, it's everything

[Common]
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

[Hook]

[Common]
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport, reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it

[Hook]

[Common]
They was one of them couples, people said they were the it
Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything

[Hook]

[Outro: Lily Allen]
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me
Love is not a mystery, it's everything




[Verse One: Kanye West]
And I’m back in a major way
And she's singing like Jamaicans say
"Waa daa dang, waa daata daata dang
That nigga got a whole lot of chains
And a whip, and a boat like a slave
And he hopping out the motherfucking Range
Why’s she getting so amped?
Cause I'm sucking on her neck like a vamp
You can feel the fangs
And she looking at my phone book like "Ayo
You got a whole lot of names."
And I’m looking at your phone book like, "Hey yo
You got a whole lot of lames."
That’s why is time to switch lanes
Cause before us it's also the same
So far, before Joistarr
And that’s why I got my favorite chick sang

[Hook: Joistarr]
I want you to be my lover
I want you to be my friend at the
At the same time
Don’t need one more than the other
I need both of him at the
At the same time

[Verse Two: Joistarr]
You are not from here
Baby, take me out
Baby, show me around
I could tell you are not from here either
I mean you want something else
I perceive all the rest, oh yes!

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Joistarr]
I’m waiting for the weekend cause…
OK, we’ll be children, so…
That you’re my homie
But I want you to have all of me!

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Joistarr]
Hey, boy you know I feel the way I do
I’m so gone
I want you, I wanna kiss in my …
In my dress, in my chest
In my heels
Isn’t me that you feel cause I

[Verse 1: Bon Iver]
Could be lookin' at you
From a freeway trailer
If you'd handled what I'd taken
Separate loans, separate codes
No fine line, don't have to be dead right
Cause dead right can go wrong

[Chorus: Francis and the Lights]
We could be friends
We could be friends
Put your head on my shoulders

[Verse 2: Francis and the Lights]
I'm Francis
Still dreamin' of a glory
Of somethin' new
I can't remember what it's like
To never wanna let go
It's all good though

[Chorus: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
We could be friends
We could be friends
Just put your head on my shoulders
I will straighten out, for you
Don't wanna know if you made mistakes
I'm still waiting on your sunshine

[Verse 3: Francis and the Lights]
Ooh, LA
I guess you gotta chase that ghost
Heard you bought some land in Mexico
And I said, "Way to go, man"
Cause wherever you may roam
Remember who you know
There's a station playin' rock and roll
So stay tuned in mi amor
Stay tuned in

[Chorus: Bon Iver & Francis and the Lights]
I will turn around for you
I will straighten up for your girl
Just put your hand on my shoulder
We could be friends, for you
We could be friends, for you
I will make this promise to you
After all these promises
I'm looking at you now
Still looking for you, still waiting for you
I told you, I'm sorry... I was waiting on a different story
Still waiting on your sunshine
What I tell you
Still waiting on your sunshine




[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Woo! Welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money
And, and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi the boss
And live from the vault, is Busta Buss

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close, gross when we give them a dose
Got them OD-ing, leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze, take notes, rock Rolls, diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Uhh, shit
Please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

[Hook: Alicia Myers & Kanye West]
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Yeah, it feel good, don't it? Uhh
For shining Your light on me
It feel good, don't it? Uhh
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Ay, I want to let y'all know
Ay, ay, I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to Q-Tip

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, "Stop killing me, wolf"
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

[Hook: Alicia Myers]
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I know it couldn't have happened without You
Ooh-ooh, without You
Ooohh, without You
Ooohh, without You




[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What a world that I'm living in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Still I feel my
Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em
Grey clouds up above man
Metaphoric to my life man
Still I feel my
Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
Until then I roll
More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
Still I feel my
Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping when my head doze
But I ain't sleep
Awake in another state
Living in a new space
Still I feel my
Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race
Until then I go

[Chorus]
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon, c'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

[Verse 2]
Grey clouds stuck together, fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
And then you see the
Awesome sound, so profound
When it – it'll grip you
You can see it
If you hear it you can feel it too
Something special I am running to
Until then I go
Away, very far away
To another universe
Where all the people say
It's the new-new place
For the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly
Wandered out of place
Take what you need
From the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown
You'll be floating higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling
But remember you can fly, high

[Chorus]
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon, c'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

[Outro]
I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up
And I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone
Yeah, na-na na-na, na-na na-na
I'm up, and away
Na-na, na-na
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Hey, hey




[Intro: sample of "Superstar" from Luther Vandross]
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
You said you'd be coming back this way again
Baby baby baby baby ohhh baby
I love you, yeah, I really do

[Saigon - over Intro]
Uhh, it's real
Dear Lord, yeah
This letter is from Saigon, the Yardfather
We fucked up Lord
Will, talk, to 'em
I tell 'em

[Saigon]
It's alright, it's alright
I know my rent is overdue, they 'bout to shut off my light
And even if I get a job, too late, you're too right
Gotta do what I gotta do to get this loot up tonight
It's alright, I write a letter dedicated to God
First I'll thank him, without him I'da never made it this far
But it's hard tryin to think of why he not gettin involved
It's a lady with a newborn baby livin in the car
The police is beatin us up, the hurricane is eatin us up
Katrina flood water was deep as a fuck
Dear Lord, are we ever gon' receive a reward
For all the sufferin and pain and misery we endure?
Just like Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the AIDS, the crack
When are we ever gon' get paid back?
PS: write your boy S to the A back
And tell Luther we got a joint we gave that stays on playback

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius (Saigon) {sample}]
{"Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?"}
When you told me you loved me (that's what you told me, ain't it?)
{"You said you'd be coming back this way again"}
(You said you, you, you said you, you said that you was comin back) I'm back
{"Baby baby baby baby ohhh baby"}
You told me you was comin back, that I would see you but you never told me when
{"I love you, yeah, I really do"}
I want you here to guide me by my side so it doesn't have to be in vain
So never leavin you again

[Saigon]
It's alright, it's alright
They narcotized our neighborhood flood the ghetto with white
My nigga only 21, he too young for two strikes
But if he catch another felony he gonna do life, that ain't right
I write a letter dedicated to our
Father who art in Heaven, Muslim brothers call him Allah
And they all tryin to think of why he not gettin involved
America is bombin them for no reason at all
Gas prices eatin us up, parole officers cheatin us yup
They lock us in for dirty pee in a cup
Ayo I know you love us Lord, but please show black people a sign
To us, society's a lethal design
Them A-T-Liens adapt to the track
Up top, we call it the block, when not most of the crackers live that
C'mon Lord, you don't see nothin the matter with that?
Hit me back, I think me and you need to chat

[Hook]

[Saigon]
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
These niggas ain't shit ma, for real yo? You better off alone
If he ain't smart enough to know why he should stay
Then what could he possibly teach his seed anyway?
You gotta grind like you never grind
Even if it mean you gotta shake your never mind, I know I read your mind
You gotta do what you gotta, get it together ma
A baby ain't temporary, that shit's forever ma
A mother's love is the freshest kind
That'll get y'all through the hard times, the pain and the stress combined
Raise your seed, you don't need no man
Especially one that need to be de-programmed
Type brother think he righteous cause he don't eat no ham
But he keep plans of fuckin with some kilograms
Girlfriend, you know what you do when the time is right
You tell your lil' one that it's alright
For real, keep your head up

[Hook]

[Outro: Saigon]
I dedicate this song, to the whole Abandoned Nation
If you've been abandoned in any sense of the word
Then you part of this Abandoned Nation
Gotta take it for what it's worth, right
God love us young brothers, that's right
To all my brothers on lockdown, the whole Abandoned Nation
Let's go

[Intro: Natalie Cole]
Just to be where you are...
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up, new day, same shit
Get dressed, gotta pay my rent
Little off for the money I spent
Next week 'til I get my check
And I don't even wanna work at this job
Matter fact I've been workin' too hard
Let's say I quit today
Come back, go postal tomorr'
This time I'ma take shit too far
I don't give a fuck who you are
When you broke they do you so wrong
When you blow they knew you was raw
Two strikes so you can't sell coke
Two kids so we can't stay broke
But the street life all we know
So you know one thing? I can't say no

[Hook: Natalie Cole]
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
If it wasn't for the fact that I so happened to be rappin'
I'd prolly be jackin', prolly be trappin'
Somewhere traffickin' packages
Takin' this shit back to the bases
But that's the past and I'm tryin' to erase this
But how the hell am I s'posed to live
When the government want half on every mil'?
The cost of gas still climbin' rapidly
And I pay the city, the county, state
And mothafuckas still out there tryna tax me
I gotta sell more ringtones
I gotta cut back and stop usin' my juke phones
Cause at the rate I'm goin'
I'm bound to lose my home off the interest rate alone

[Hook: Natalie Cole]
I can't say no
(I can't say no, I can't say no)
I can't say no
(I can't say no, no)
I can't say no
(I can't say no)
I can't say no

[Outro: Trick Daddy]
How can I say no?
How can I say no after all this time?
If it wasn't for the ghetto, where would I be?
If it wasn't for those food stamps and welfare checks mama used to give me
Where would I be?
If it wasn't for the hood, if it wasn't for the addicts
If it wasn't for the fact that they was on drugs
That they didn't know enough not to get on drugs
Shit wasn't for the struggle
Wasn't for bad luck
Wouldn't be nothin'




[Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)
Na, na, na, na, na (get off me)
Runnin' up softly (get off me)
Go win it or something? (get off-)




[Intro]
People looked at me differently and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in the line at bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.  I mean I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!

[Chorus]
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night

[Verse]
Look at my situation, I couldn’t ask for more
I’m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
Look what that kilo sent me, that Porsche is key less entry
That girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary
We found a superfreak, no, she won’t know what hit her
I’m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter
You’ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking
You don’t get good dick too often, I’mma have you funny walking
See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in
Back to that world you lost in

[Bridge]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
(Run for your life, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Outro]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

[Intro]
Yeah, you wanna be loved, yeah
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna be loved, yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, everywhere I’ll be
I see lonely hearts and falling leaves
Where do those hearts go, do they find their match
Or do they drift away, it’s time to bring them back

[Hook 1]
They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
They wanna be loved, yeah

They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
They wanna be loved

[Verse 2]
But everybody knows it don’t always last
But if I can’t have it for long, then I want it fast
Better love for now, then for never old
So baby, if you’re down, give me a call!

[Hook 2]
I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
I wanna be loved, yeah
Alright, c'mon

I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
I wanna be loved
Yeah

[Bridge]
La la la la
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved
Yeah, sing for love, yeah!
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved?


[Hook 3]
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
You wanna be loved, yeah
Alright

You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
You wanna be loved, oh yeah!




[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"
[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word
[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me
[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh




Clap your hands everybody
Clap your hands
Come on, keep it going
Clap your hands everybody
Clap your hands everybody
Clap your hand
Lets do it ,you ready?
Come on

We could fight like Ike and Tina
Or give back like Bill and Camille
Be rich like Oprah and Steadman
Or instead struggle like Flow and James Evans
Cuz he ain't no different from you
And she ain't no different from me
So we got to live out our dreams
Like the people on TV

We gotta stay tuned
Cuz there's more to see (Unbreakable)
Through the technical difficulties (Unbreakable)
We might have to take a break
But ya'll know we'll be back next week
I'm singing this love is unbreakable
Oh yeah yeah...

Yeah, clap your hands everybody
Clap your hands everybody
Lets do it like this, come on

See, we could act out like Will and Jada(Will and Jada)
Or like Kimora and Russell makin' paper, oh yeah
All in the family like the Jacksons(like the Jacksons)
And have enough kids to make a band like Joe and Catherine, yeah

She ain't no different from me
And he ain't no different from you
So we got to live out our dreams
Like the people on TV

We gotta stay tuned
Cuz there's more to see (Unbreakable)
Through the technical difficulties (Unbreakable)
We might have to take a break
But ya'll know we'll be back next week

This love is unbreakable(ha,ha,ha,yeah,yeah)
Break it down, break it down like this

No thing, no money, no sin, no temptation, talking 'bout nothing
No thing, no money, no sin, no temptation, talking 'bout nothing

[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Chorus]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Chorus]
Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...

[Intro: Mos Def & Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, yeah, there it go, there it is
This, is something special (uh-huh, yeah)
This, is something new (it's an amazing time)
This, is something special (look around)
This, is something new (the power of observation)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyāmah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small, furthermore
The end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them? Sweet Jesus
Enlighten the Earth, seek heaven first
Let's put in this work

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood, where did you acquire those Alaïas?
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that's nuts
I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks, we ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche, then put me in your coochie
I swear they shoulda never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord (you know, AK on the lamp like what's that?)
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (huh? Click clack)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
All white Bentley, I call that mama
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick? Well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, I'm what's happening, I get it cracking
All black Carbon, on my wrist, yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too, if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean, or Mr. Boss
See me riding clean, in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy, but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me? I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood, in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck?
100 feet and better, what the fuck you stick?
Paparazzi on the water with the fuck-you stick
My face got the "fuck you pricks"
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos, we do the goddamn thing

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Get down with the precious leathers
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Aiyyo, open glass on my fingers, I sit back like I'm caged
But still caking, my niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak, I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger stones they throw
That's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine, nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction, I'm sun, he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law or maybe some nigga trying to score

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord)
L-Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord, Lord)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord, Lord, Lord) Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord! Uh, hey
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
L-L-L-L-L-L-Lord, Lord
Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Lordy, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, hahahah
That's kind of how this rap was pieced, hahahah
Most definitely this rap was pieced




[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 1]
I sold my soul to the devil: that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
It's feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 2]
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
I’m spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Let's exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious, gettin' anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say I’ve been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I’m not right dog, I’m slightly off
I’m paranoid; like bonin’ raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that’ll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should’ve took nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

[Hook]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground




[Intro: MIA & Pusha-T]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
No one on the corner got swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
You see, the rap game can't give you swagger
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
The streets can't give you swagger
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Believe it or not, money can't even give you swagger
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger's something you gotta be born with
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
I think it's safe to say that everybody on this track right here definitely got they swagger intact
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
Without further ado, Re-Up Gang Records

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Pusha Ton is in the building
Powder to the motherfucking ceiling
I'm so consistent every verse
I prototyped this coke flow, y'all just my children
Don't get caught up in your feelings because
You just original fakes and I am the cause
If you follow fashion, you can follow my bars
If not, get your Hypebeast on, follow the blogs
(No one on the corner) has swagger like such
Two diamond chains, my neck on its double-dutch
Standing in my action figure pose for them hoes
A.P.C. Denim the tops is Play Cloths
Yuugh! The trend-humper vs. the trend-setter
The CL is V-12, the V for vendetta
"Til the Casket Drops" in '09
The meaning of a classic is defined, yes!

[Hook: M.I.A. & Pusha-T]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Til the Casket Drops coming soon
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
Play Cloths in stores
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
If you addicted to the fly, go get that shit
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
You know how we do! Haha!
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
All this money...

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
No one on the corner got swagger like us
Cocaine cowboys, too much to flush
You can't comprehend all the paper I touch
All the jewels run their colors; then the chain just blush
I see, I want, I cop, hardtop
I Busta Rhymes—"Tear the roof off"—I must
Lamborghini two-door, drug dealer's rush
Bad bitch, shotgun, new Lou Vuitton clutch
Purse says "Hérmes," not Von Dutch
I Autobahn lean on the clutch like a crutch
Who you know this fly? Give it to 'em pinched right
Gucci hard-bottoms, names scribbled in the inside
See you haters through the Gs on the aviator lenses
My friends in Benzes
Three Ms on the hood emb-uh-lem
Got the curtains pulled back so the sun shines
And it's just me shimmering
Haha! With a whole lot of women friends

[Hook]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us

[Verse 3: Malice]
I say it's more about style rather than fashion
It's class when you show a ho cash without flashin'
I can even grab on they ass without askin'
The '09 Jag, look what the cat dragged in
My past no good, my present still shameful
The fact I'm in his nose should show that I'm no angel
By far, my baddest bitch was Anglo
Met her in London Fog, Burberry raincoat
We ain't in the same boat, throw on the life jacket
Voted for Barack, McCain was my tax bracket, though
I Sarah Palin hoes, kick 'em out, leave the clothes
Back to the pipeline, luckily I'm twinkletoes
I hold the flask with a wrinkled nose
My connect basis is a need-to-know
The gavel slam and I'm free to go
It couldn't have ended on a sweeter note, yes!

[Hook: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger, swagger like us




[Intro]
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Change if you can do without the things I can't get you
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
Hmh-hmm-hmm
The kind of stuff you earn
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Feel like De Nero on Casino
Louis suit got me lookin' like Pacino
Rings and cash for you to burn
Got the goose and it's chillin' on the ice
The kind of stuff you earn
What you expect? Meet a girl, got her blowin' on the dice, ooh
She just told me, "Yandhi, you my hero"
I can tell that girl just wants the free clothes
Rings and cash for you to burn
For her cousins, aunties and her freak hoes
The kind of stuff you earn
But her cousin's auntie is a freak-ho

[Chorus]
Change if you can move a country
And the piece don't cost no money
Rings and cash for you to burn
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned (Feel like)
(The kind of stuff you earn)
Change if you can move a country (Uhh)
(Change if you can do without the things I can't get you)
And the piece don't cost no money (You know that)
(Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn)
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned (Feel like)
(The kind of stuff you earn)

[Bridge]
Uhh
Change if you can do without the things I can't get you
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn
When's enough enough bae? Uhh

[Verse 2]
Everything's all gucci when we up in Gucci
I just made a (Rrr-ghgh) and I called it Chewie
Rings and cash for you to burn
The B-I-G contour, no, this shit ain't juicy
The kind of stuff you earn
But I just hit the fade when I'm feelin' Boosie
Been had these dreams since I was yay-high
Pull up-up in the Benz and let the bass ride
I was doin' this shit before you was outside
Everything is good here on our side
Change if you can do without the things I can't get you
Everything is good here on our side
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
Now you know we off the handles (Skrrt), off the handles
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
Just to make an example for niggas that want hit me
The kind of stuff you earn
But won't hit me for a sample

[Chorus]
Change if you can move a country
And the piece don't cost no money
Rings and cash for you to burn
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned (Feel like)
The kind of stuff you earn
Change if you can move a country (Uhh)
Change if you can do without the things I can't get you
And the piece don't cost no money (You know that)
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned (Feel like)
The kind of stuff you earn




In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless? Oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talking to me, though
You need to watch the way you talking to me, yeah

So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well, I got homies
In the end it's still so lonely

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless?
Yeah, how could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
I know you can't believe

I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Vocal Sample]
Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, Yeah
[Repeat]

Yeah, it's for the people

[Bridge: Common]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 1: Common]
And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was  harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', trying get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Bridge]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 2: Common]
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Bridge]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 3: Common]
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, Mr. West is in the building, children, ladies
Call the shrink up, they about to go crazy
Hold your drinks up like you was celebratin'
Hold your guns if they is hella hatin'
I'm so clean and them, they got rabies
I can see it through the lens of my Raybe-
Ans, Wayfarers, mmhm
'Ye do you play fair? Mm-mm
Grab your remote for the reason they made TiVo
Snap the Nikons at the icon with Nikes on
I heard you like to do it with the lights on
But I really make babies when the mic's on
Check out all my kids, that bought all my cribs
Got me out of that apartment, you have got to pardon him
I am so retarded with a spit like a retarded kid that spits
Oops, I ain't mean to say that ****
I told my homie Chris, these chicks is dangerous
You need a girl that's A-List, not one that just barely made it on a list
'Cause from wall to wall, we got it poppin' right now
It's a hundred girls, tryna get down, down, down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, gotta tell you
Seen you somewhere before, you look familiar
You had a red shirt, Gucci slacks, and a Gucci bag to match it
Tell me you remember that, baby girl
But lady, never mind that
Can I take you out later? And here's my contact
Can you do me this favor? Let me spend this paper
On you 'cause it's just sitting and let's spend it and go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me, let me
Guarantee, guarantee
I'll make your da-a-ay

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
The way I see it, girl, you a perfect 10
That's why I'm all on you, baby, you got me wondering
What to do, what to say, don't want to come off lame
Girl, do you got a man? Better yet, girl, what's your name?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me, let me, guarantee, guarantee
I'll make your da-a-ay, okay
Now if you with it, shawty, shawty, let me, let me
Take your bad away, baby, can we dream, just for today?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna get down, down, down, down (Hey, hey, not even crazy, gotta get down)

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button (what?) nothin' man
Now super bad chicks givin' me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques, just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out, and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 1: Un Casa]
It's a shame how I rap so bananas
It's Mr. Two-Gun Un
Motherfuckers better cock back them hammers
You might catch me in the drop blowin pop with Santana
The hawk on me's not from Atlanta
It's just the father to the Glocks in the hamper
Look in the rear view the cops in the camera
I flow hot like blocks down in Tampa
And leave you dead pop shot from them blammers
And go down south and rock wit them bamas
And come back in the Porsche color hot banana
Vanilla coat seats piper made by Tropicana
Speakers do the wop rims do the Macerana
This is Taliban Dipset Roc-A-Fella
It ain't nuthin for Two-Gun to pop a fella
Killa signed me now I got the mozerella
I promised Hell Rell Un Cas gon' rock forever

[Interlude: Un Casa (Cam'ron)]

[Verse 2: Un Casa]
Yo I'm livin' in the equinox
Niggas eat with Glocks
Enough steel it'll cease the block
Add yeast to increase the rock
I got knowledge that can teach my pops
Watch my pockets increase with knots
Play the low so I speak to cops
Walk the beat in my bop in my beef and brocs
Ice in my piece an watch
Ain't too many niggas that can reach the top
Or speak this hot
Peep this pop I leave you not
I rhyme over beats with the meanest drops
And teens'll flock
Seen my spot, seen my prop
Ran when you seen the cops
Got your wife sucking semen cocks
I'ma Taliban lyrical monster
They'll shout a city I conquer
White Ice cinnamon Parker
Al Qaeda's most vividest author
Hundred thou just ta glitter the charm up
45th sides grittiest monster
The truck look like the city of Tonka
Dame here ta say this nigga is bonkers
Whoa far as the flow I'm the realest nigga spittin' it
Niggas talk hustle game but I'm really gettin' it
Anything I want an need nigga I'm gettin' it
745 Gucci top with the stick in it
The ice is so clear like the shit fishes swimmin' in
I ain't Diddy y'all but I'm strictly for the benjamins
I'm the boss I ain't dealin' with you middle men
Bout ta cop a Yukon white made in cinnamon

[Outro: Un Casa (Cam'ron)]
Niggas get y'all fuckin' car game up
(Diplomats, that's what's really fuckin' good)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable

[Verse 1]
Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she don't fuck niggas with Apple watches
Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting
Shout out to dope boy lit 16 swipers
Howard homecoming kingpins
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin' bottle wars
40 thousand on the floor when them bottles pour (Spill, nigga)
A Blu Ray to your DVD
You might've caught me on TMZ
Cameo tryna sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)
Cause I party hard like it's three of me
America's still abusing us
And 9/11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back
When every day them niggas shooting us?
True enough, I'm out of line
You better stand for something 'fore you out of time
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable

[Verse 2]
Poppy get me everything I want
Riding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
What I'm cooking in the kitchen, niggas
Bobby Brown, New Edition, niggas
What I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga
Mink, leather or it's lizard, nigga
Saint Laurent, I'm in all layers
The mannequin to you ballplayers
Shout out my Mac 11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And though that nigga only 5'9"
100 bodies on his timeline
What's the price of success?
Lost my bitch, bought a chef
The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jeweler's heaven
Hottest 7, I'm so alive
Your bank account Swiss, nigga, so is mine
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable

And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out

[DMX]
Started gettin a little too big for the cage that I been trapped in
Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin to rappin
Guns got the clappin, another trip to the morgue
We all know why it's happenin, another bit by the dog
When there's nothin left to eat, I ate away at my soul
Felt destructive cause I don't give a fuck if I go
I know y'all been told I don't give a fuck about livin
Killin other dogs got you cats chasin bitches
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within
What I catch I'mma eat, in the streets I'mma win
I've been top dog and I'mma stay top dog
So what the fuck you got to say dog?
You cats play games that dog ain't with
Suck my dick, behind my back dog ain't shit
Well this is it, from now on if you ain't out the camp
We out to clamp, put 'em up against the champ
You bitch

[Hook x2]
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon

[DMX]
I don't think you cats see too clearly
If it ain't that you must be deaf, cause y'all niggas don't hear me
But I know I got you scared to death
How many other niggas you know when you see 'em make you hold your breath?
All a nigga did was take a pause
Did a couple of movies and you thought this whole rap shit was yours?
Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggas like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't wanna see your man missin, man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit
The way dog flip out, cats'll never understand
Niggas be like "X I thought I was your man!"
Not!

[Hook]

This is dedicated to, this is dedicated to
The streets, this is dedicated to

[DMX]
My dogs is dogs that love to brawl
Bring as many as you got cause we gon fuck 'em all
Dicksucked in the hall
The same shorty thats puttin any work on her knees
I'm duckin her call
A dog is a dog is a dog for life, dog been a dog, dog in your wife
I got kids this age
But let 'em keep talkin slick and I'm gon put somethin hot up in his ribcage

[Hook]

When the dog is out, bitch ass niggas get bit or fucked
One or the two, and I'm not Ja Rule
Feel me? Aight




[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
London stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside
We gon' set this party off right
We set this party off right or what?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Okay that's it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, " ---- , I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
‘Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
Her had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retailers, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Everybody say "all falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Lemme hear you sing "all falls down"
And when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this (for real)
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean - a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, everybody say "all falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I can't hear you!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And George Bush get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Now everybody say "all falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now lemme hear you say "all falls down"
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Let's go, Let's go, lemme hear you say "all falls down"
One more time, One more time
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
From the front to the back say "all falls down"
And when it all falls down

"And I brought—"
"And I brought—"
"And I brought—dreams"
"—dreams"
"—dreams"
"And I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"
"I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you"

[Verse 1: The Game + Sample]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a ("Dream")
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

[Hook: The Game + Sample]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a ("Dream")
Aaliyah had a ("Dream"), Left Eye had a ("Dream")
So I reached out to Kanye and ("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")

[Verse 2]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
"It's a hard knock life, then you pass away"
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a ("Dream")
Aaliyah had a ("Dream"), Left Eye had a ("Dream")
So I reached out to Kanye and ("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")

[Verse 3]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a ("Dream")
Aaliyah had a ("Dream"), Left Eye had a ("Dream")
So I reached out to Kanye and ("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")

[Outro: The Game + Sample]
This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday, September 14th, 2003: rest in peace
("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")
("And I brought—"
"And I brought—"
"And I brought—dreams"
"—dreams"
"—dreams")
("And I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you...")









Had two bitches Carolina from the north and the south
Didn't know which one i wanted had to figure it out
Had the one name Catalina she was good with the greens
And the other smoke more than Charlie Sheen
Couldn't choose between the two because you know they both queens
Took em both back home and we menage in the trees
Im che guevara the rapper
Maybe a little more dapper
Revolutionized the shit
So you can suck on my dick
This ain't that maybach music
This that way wack music
This that play back music
And i dont suck like a tick
Tock your bitch still on the clock
I shoot my shot like a Glock
And you know its no shock
When she suckin on my cock
They say im mindlessly flexin
I am just lyrically hexin
All of my opps when they hanging
Round all my chicks i been banging
You gotta watch what you thanking
Or i will leave your ass hanging
Strange fruit in the trees
This is my hive we the bees
I ride this beat different keys
Stay off my dogs youre just fleas
Rappers claimin shit
I check it like ritchie t
Yo
I know you beggin for pity
In that story you never told
Hit up the homies for dirt
Sorry man they loyal
I pull up all like SKRRRT
In the coupe bitch im royal
They say im drownin in influence
Bitch im drownin in cash
Get the fuck off my dick
Before i get on your ass
Man holly she wild
I know ethan sayin shit
Why ackin like a child
Its not my fault you ain't lit
If holly hit my line
You know i’d let her hit
Because she still kinda fine
And she got nice tits
Just look at hailie mane
If i were you i’d be ashame
(spoken) i mean, shes not terrible looking or anything, but i can do better, ya feel? i dunno man

These rappers talk about me
Thats just more clout for me
I met all they girls and they pussy kinda smelly
I met all they girls and they girls try to fuck me
Im too busy with the rap game i be runnin
My crew in the cut and yknow we ain't stuntin
Sometimes in this life you just gotta go crazy
Full year later and i still ain't met my baby
Full year later and these bitches still hatin
I ate a bitches ass like a coconut
Fuck that i couldn't even bust a nut
Yall hear that line and be like what the fuck
With these girls i ain't got the besta luck




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Outro: Kanye West & Section 25]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Don't now, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
They don't wanna see me love you
And forget all your cares
They don't wanna see me love you
Throw them
Throw them away
Ooh, life's a feeling and
Ooh, the body is a feeling, yeah




Let me get my theme music (x2)
'Aye, Let me get my theme music (x2)

[Hook: T-Pain] + (Kanye West)
Baby, just forget everything that you know
Let's take it all the way back to hello
They say you livin' like you died before
I got a place that only I can go
Let me take you to flight school
(We'll learn to fly)
Let me take you to flight school
(Above all the lights)
You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly?
Flight school

[Verse 1: GLC]
I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin' time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel
Gizelle
Dress fresh as hell
Louis
Gucci
Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
The Air Yeez', she never seen these
So the moment I might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin life's dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I got my superman power, my superman cape
These the last hours, but superman late
The clock is ticking, damn can you wait?
Man, will he come back and save the day?
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse
That'll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head, great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away, then we performed CPR
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimp'd My crib, so I must exhibit
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit

[Hook]

Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me

Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
'Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

[Intro (Kanye West)]
You like to ride... (uh)
(So "why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends"
"(My friends) my friends, my friends, my friends"
Would you like to ride?
(I don't know what happened, it's just like, heh)
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
'Cause five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Rob and G. Dep
Then I'mma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

[Hook]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

[Verse 2: Malik Yusef]
Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle 'dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you
Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife
Stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways goin' Wild West like Kanye
Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddamnit I'm grown
Broke broad I'mma leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

[Hook]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

So, so well
Well, right
So, so
High as the sun come out
Plannin'
Bootin'
Plannin'
Movin'
Plannin'
Tubin', there
Well, well

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Clean us like the rain in spring
Take the chlorine out our conversation
Let Your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water
We are water
Pure as water
Like a newborn daughter

[Verse 1: Ant Clemons]
The storm may come
But we'll get through it because of Your love
Either way, we crash like water
Your love's water
Pure as water
We are water

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Jesus, flow through us
Jesus, heal the bruises
Jesus, clean the music
Jesus, please use us
Jesus, please help
Jesus, please heal
Jesus, please forgive
Jesus, please reveal
Jesus, give us strength
Jesus, make us well
Jesus, help us live
Jesus, give us wealth
Jesus is our safe
Jesus is our rock
Jesus, give us grace
Jesus, keep us safe

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Clean us like the rain in spring
Take the chlorine out our conversation
Let Your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water
We are water
Pure as water
Like a newborn daughter

[Outro: Kanye West]
We like water, mmh

High as the sun come out
Plannin'
Bootin'

Man, you know I love you right?
You just got to be real with me, is you cheating on me?

Nigga, there you go with that shit again

Baby, you know how I feel about you, I'm trying to make this work
My guys keeping coming to me, telling me they seeing you and stuff
How this making me look? Buying you them rings
Them leathers, getting your hair done every week
Gotta let me know sumthin

[Infamous Syndicate]
Look, if you don't trust me why the fuck is you with me?
Coming at me on some Jay Z shit, who you with?
Calling my cell, leaving crazy voicemails
Figured you can get me if you called my girl Nikki
But she was with me and I was home at seven fifty
But that was when he got technical with it
Talkin' 'bout he called my house at seven fifty nine
I don't keep up with the time, what the fuck you think I'm lyin'?
It all comes down to you trust me or you won't
The bottom line is you love me or you don't
And do you need me baby?

Yeah you know I do

So you believe me baby?

Yeah for sure I do

Then he gave me a hug, jumped in the trunk and went to work
He managed to leave without getting his feelings hurt
So I sat back, flamed up the weed and thought up
Who the hell done run their mouth and almost got me caught up

[Hook: Infamous Syndicate & (Kanye West)]
I said boy don't you know what you do to me?
He said ("But I don't usually")
I said boy don't you know what you do to me?
He said ("You know I don't usually")
I said boy don't you know what you do to me?
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
Look you can't be tellin' people that you doin' me
You gotta keep this here between you and me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look, I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around, you don't speak to me
When my girl be around, I see you peepin' me
When they both ain't around, you be freakin' me
We used to do it secretly, now you all talk
You tellin' everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin' on cause my story keep changin' up
You gotta stop callin' up my crib and hangin' up
Truthfully, if you tellin' people that you doin' me
Then you tellin' me that you don't even wanna screw with me
And that's a shame, I can't even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think it's a game, but I don't wanna play no more
You wanna stay, but you can't stay no more
You wanna be with K, but that ain't okay no more
You got somethin' to say, but you ain't gotta say no more

[Hook: Kanye West & (Infamous Syndicate)]
I said girl don't you know what you do to me?
She said ("But I don't usually")
I said girl don't you know what you do to me?
She said ("You know I don't usually")
I said girl don't you know what you do to me?
I be hatin' when you actin' brand new to me
I'mma tell your ass now baby truthfully
I ain't told nobody that you doin' me

[Kanye West]
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check, they ain't never where they're supposed to be
I learned my lesson, now I only fuck hoes that's close to me
Don't get me wrong you still gotta live close to me
This ain't a song I made for ugly hoes to start approachin' me
You know how this go, I diss hoes
I'm very mean now, my Roley face green now, I bring your self esteem down

[Infamous Syndicate]
I knew since the day I met you if I would fuck you or not
So later on I asked my girl how many bitches you got
I never loved you a lot, but then this nigga got turned out
He told his boy that told his boy and now the words out
My man approachin' me with rumors that he heard about

[Kanye West]
But dude a lame, he probably asked you can he work it out?

[Infamous Syndicate]
I swear y'all, betta keep the game on'em
Yeah y'all now watch me change on'em
Rule one, never tell your nigga who you fucked
And always smile back if he tell you he in love
Rule two, most men try to control you
Take my advice cause its so true what women go through
And rule three you thinkin' he don't cheat and he committed
He still get invitations from the last girl he been with
Bet his ho be mad, I bet she tell you that he hit it
Just check inside his pocket find another bitches digits

[Hook: Infamous Syndicate & Kanye West]

[Outro]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
These girls out here be thinkin' they caught up and shit
Fuck that, spend that nigga yo, you know what I'm sayin'
You catch yourself up, you go to him
Let that nigga come to you with no type of evidence, you ain't got shit on you
I'mma do my thing, word up, uh
Pimp on baby




[Intro]
See.. some niggas don't know how to act..
So I'm about to get on some Left Eye shit
And start burnin' down niggas cribs

[Verse 1]
When we met, I can't front, I was all in your shit
Even though I was a bitch playin' hard to get
'Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me 'bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And "Heartbreaker" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Yeah, uh-huh uh-huh, you don't wanna mess with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
(Do you know, who I am?)
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Don't be messin' with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Hehe, yeah, you don't wanna mess with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(You don't wanna mess around)

[Verse 2]
Breakfast in Paris, dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach, yeah we had it goin' on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years, and now you wanna dump me?
And just to think, I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin said she was havin' one too?
You wrong! Nigga dead wrong, you know the song
"Don't know what you've got til it's gone"
After the fight, the other night, and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up, I was "Waiting to Exhale"
(That's right)

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(You don't wanna mess with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
(I'm the Queen Bitch)
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Don't be messin' with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Hmm, you don't wanna mess with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Yeah, now hold that)

[Verse 3]
Now I'm back to my old ways, like in the old days
Flirtin', not givin' a fuck, what?
Got you lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Damn!"
Sick thinkin bout the next man fuckin this tight pussy
Niggas want me, even though they got a honey
If I'ma be number two, they givin' me some hush money
Ask Whitney, I learned how to break a heart from you
Cause when a woman's fed up, it ain't nothin' you can do
I'm that Bitch, don't you ever forget
Witchu when you rich or when you ain't have shit
Now he cryin', he beggin', "Kim let me come back"
Like Mark Morrison, "Return of the Mack" baby!

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(You don't wanna mess with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Don't be messin' with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Y'all niggas don't wanna mess with me)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Cause I'm not the one)
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
Heartbreaker, dream maker.. you're a
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
Heartbreaker, dream maker.. you're a

[Verse 1]
Baby it seems the time is never right
You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting

[Prehook]
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do

[Hook]
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

[Bridge]
If I dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream
Oh, I dream
Yes, I dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true

[Verse 2]
Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I

[Hook]
Can dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true




[Verse 1: Jhene]
See I got a lot to say
And I ain't afraid to say it
Mind on money so it's why I'm tryin' to make it
Yeah, but the money's what you make it
Let it make you see where it's gon' take ya
Hey, you'll be headed nowhere
Moving so fast you won't even care
Yeah, but when you get there
What you gon' do when nobody's there?
Ay, I know what you're gonna say
Made it there alone so you don't worry 'bout they
Hey, but when it all goes away
You gonna be stuck so what I'm tryna say is
Don't lose your

[Hook]
Soul
Oh, Let go, let go of your ego
Don't lose your soul
Sail your soul
Sailing soul

[Verse 2: Jhene]
Is it really worth it?
You are only hurting yourself
You will never grow if you lose control over yourself
(Don't let go)
If you don't get a hold of yourself
Then you will end up with no self
You're Playing the game for the fame in the end
But what do you gain when you're paying to win?
You don't
You better keep your soul
Set sail or get sold, oh

[Verse 3: Kanye]
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me whack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
He's checking my background
It's ironic whats happening, imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain’t finna change, so we'll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood, we can see out with our eyes closed
G.O.O.D. Music

[Hook]




[Verse: Gil Scott-Heron]
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?

[Claps and applause]




[Part I]

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, "Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo' ass is acting"
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo' ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Part II]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead, bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the "love" word

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah




[Verse 1: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
Lifestyle on camera (Camera)
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier (Chandelier)
They tried to turn me to an animal (Animal)
But white people think I'm radical (Radical)
Supermodels think I'm handsome (Handsome)
You might think I'm too aggressive (Aggressive)
But really I think I'm too passive (Hey)
'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin' (Bow)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggas say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
And I'm fresh out of debt in this muhfucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a muhfucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on (Huh?)
Now that Gucci home, it's over for you Gucci clones

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go (straight up)

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through they secret identities
Lately, it's all about Zen in me
Subtractin' the negative energy
Fuck with the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas keep it a century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Top my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
With...

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

[Verse 5: 2 Chainz]
I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship
In that hoe mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way
Nothin' to say, I tote 'em choppas like pool sticks
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I'm comin' from the apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round
Play with the kid, I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trap shit let me slow it down
Way more shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom

[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp (Gucci!)
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]
1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round it go
'Round and 'round they go
I'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole




[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Woo, woo)
Woo, woo, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh
Switch your⁠, switch your attitude
Go 'head, level up yourself

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Life too short, go spoil yourself
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself 'cause

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Switch my, switch my attitude
I'm so, I'm so radical
All these people mad at dude
This for who it matter to
What if Eve made apple juice?
You gon' do what Adam do?
Or say, "Baby, let's put this back on the tree" 'cause

[Refrain: Ant Clemons & Ty Dolla $ign]
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)

[Intro]
Let's do it!
Santana, Jim Jones, Killa, Freekey
How long we gon' have this shit on lock, man?
Yes sir, you gave me the right track Kanye

[Verse 1]
Listen, I been coppin' them P's and
Maybe that's part of the reason
I feel like a boxer: bobbin' and weavin'
But I'm gettin' head, she's bobbin' her weave and (yes sir)
I'm grabbin' her neck to stop her from breathin'
I'ma wild out until I part with my breathin'
Until I'm sparked up and leakin', part of the cement
I need somethin' pure, like from the Garden of Eden (why?)
Wouldn't mind makin' her part of my achievements (what happened)
'Cause when music discourage my pride (who was there?)
Zeke the only one with courage to ride
The ride's so dirty inside, seems like we were playin' in mud
Hazin' it up, grams, gauge and a snub
Who ill? A check for two mil'
And a cheap case, defaced, blue steel, true skills
I got stories that my soul can sing
Flip water like Poland Spring and I'ma hold them things

[Break]
{Forever} that's right y'all
Diplomats y'all, we here
{Forever, yea-yeah} that's forever man

[Verse 2]
Look, talk to 'em
Look, my fella said you been coppin' a lot
Latest caper? Propellers on top of the drop
But fuck it, who ever thought I would rock at the Roc? (Killa!)
Top a top on top of the top
But yo - nothing definite, I chop up the rocks
And I stop up the drop, Blocka Blocka the block
Hello mate, yellow tape, helicopter your spot
What you wanted is not what you got
And I pop up them cops
'Cause dog, it ain't about Cam (it ain't about me)
I got a son homeboy, it's about Cam (for that?)
It's about being 'bout It
If you're not, you're ass backwards
My mathematics cause cash matters (that's important)
Little niggas need to sit up and breathe
If the town too hot, get up and leave
Niggas always got a trick up their sleeve (always)
Nigga like me - I always got a brick up my sleeve
And that's for-e-ver

[Break]
{Forever} Jim Jones, Freekey, Santana
{Forever, yea-yeah} we here, we here
I got it Guru (let's wrap it up man)

[Verse 3]
Shit, I was two blocks from coppin' dust
I used to hop the bus
Now look dogg, ain't nobody hot as us
Girls, they gotta rush, shit, they gotta blush
Wanna go in the mall just to shop with us
To how they piss and, bitch, how they ran a mile
Fuck Killa Cam, they in love with Cameron Giles
Damn, I gotta smile, hundred grand, I demand it
Goddamn it, the boy the boy done done it, child
And that's forever, man

[Outro]
You hear it, uh huh
We here, I love y'all man
It's nothing boy
Dash, Hoffa, Young Guru
What's really good?
Holla at your boy
I might have this shit on lock man
Kanye, Harlem, Chicago, Columbus - holla
Chicago, you have your own Kanye West on the track
Harlem, you know who the fuck I am - Killa!
We just want you's to know Diplomats is here
We ain't going nowhere
Holla at ya boy-boy, let's ride out man




"Electro-convulsive therapy part one."

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I can't stop till we all ball
And walk around with gold in our mouth like Paul Wall
Nigga fuck all y'all
I'll just stay on the grind and sell out beats
Til I'm all over the hood like LRG
Matter fact all over Chicago
And I'm about to be on Oprah tomorrow
There's nothin' nobody can ever say to top that line
I'm in housewives' livin' rooms, stop that shine
Y'all already know Kan is a legend like John is
Rockin' that Louis Vuitton that only a don get
Got beef, bitches gettin' they Boost on
They bring me that Gucci I give 'em a Boost phone
Fel feel the new song so he give it airplay
Got calls 'bout Diamond from Nas and Jay on the same day
Fan's askin', "Where yo ass been?"
Weak niggas been eatin' while you been fastin'
But you can ask Kaz 1
When my shit drop, y'all has-beens
Been gainin' popularity now I'm bout to cash in

[Verse 1: Bump J]
I used to sell coke before I got in this rap shit
I wrap bricks now my [?] is a mattress
You runnin' from the cops, tryin' to get that lil' pack flipped
I'm runnin' round tryin' to stick my dick in an actress
The mac spit, it can make that ass do back flips
Smoke a nigga, I'd rather just poke a nigga like cactus
Come up off that [?]
Take a nigga's jewels then walk right past him with them on the next day
Goons
Mob get in, get in tune
It's plenty room
The back seats feel like a living room
He's a great
These left rights will beat your face
Poppin' bottles, my brother just beat his case
I up the iron, every one of you will bail
I got fully semi hand guns and none of them for sale
Yeah, homie peep my steez
My ice game sick, I got a lot of stones like

[Verse 3: Sly Polaroid]
You know what I'm about
Money and gun play
The right stain will make a nigga rich in one day
Rappers
Stop askin' about Boogz and Kanye
You know I can't let your stupid ass get Bump J
I'm ten with a gun when I fired it work
Around the same time I got tired of church
Yeah, as a shorty I ain't play with the fireworks
I ran up on niggas and show them how the fire work
I remember when we was just kids with no names
Then we start robbin' dealerships, usin' cocaine
The money was best, the power was next
For that paper
I shoot slugs out of the tec
I mean Sly jumped out of the rest
And have a nigga butt naked, puttin' cigarettes out on his chest
I'm a Goon Squad gangster you can't make a nigga say we cowards
Niggas already know what it is when they play the album
I hustle the streets with the shit that look like baby powder
You was at home with a bitch, tryin' to suck a baby bottle
They took me out the streets now I'm back on 'em
Fuck a credit card, know Sly got the stacks on 'em
Know that
And know Sly got the straps on 'em
My white Air Force 1's don't got a scratch on 'em
If I ain't a gangsta nigga what do you call that?
I fresh out on bond with a pistol and all black
If you was gettin' money I was comin' for all that
Cheif gave me a hundred thou
Told me to fall back
You heard about the shit we carry around
I kidnap, rob 'em, starve niggas
Last victim lost thirty pounds
This is a dirty town
I wouldn't of never took 'em but he called for the cheese and
His bitch didn't hurry down




[Hook: (Kid Talking)]
Hey big spender, hey big spender, hey big spender

[Bridge: Nick Cannon]
I don't see no shows, I don't see no rolls
I don't see no lolos, and a low profile
As far as the wardrobe goes, all those ain't your clothes
The product placement videos with no logos
You got a chain, no glow
Got a deal, no dough
Just the same, Joe small throwbacks and corn ropes

[Verse 1]
Not a good first weeks, worry gonna blow
But there's no need to front you broke we both know
Had the hoes rolling in drows
Now you over exposed
Pointing to your account and the amounts you owe
Your record was so close not def just so so
How you label don't know you on talking no show
The only time you in the streets is just signs for promos
Yo everybody know who wrote your stole flow
You gotta pay him too, your publician's a no go
I got speddy gonzales dollars and yours is slow mo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You never seen a nigga quite like this before
He was stunting hard as hell before you even got to blow
Magazines claim he gassed like Texaco
Cause Jesus walk with him in Mexico
Back when the cars cost too much to floss
Them alligator boots? I stitched those
Body official, how, when my money stayed in the rear like Game or DJ Quik's clothes
And I just wanted to go platinum one time
Nick, he still spending money from Drumline
Man when I finish this Usher tour up
I'ma try my best to clear my credit score up
It it cause the Yves Saint Laurent on the glasses?
Or is it cause my name on them backstage passes?
Niggers always asking where his maybachs is
Motherfucker have you seen my taxes?

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Nick Cannon]
They thought you was gonna blow, but now you weren't
I got good news though, I just saved the car insurance
You probably learn and this music game all in crack
Need to go back to slinging crack
In fact you wasn't even good at doing that
Yo your street credibility, you ruined that
Trying to be [?] and pursuing rap
Far as wack contracts, you was doomed from that
Manger threw your door, now you sewing black
What I get for a track you never make in life
I'm like when coke just hit, I make a million a night
Yo what happened to your [?]?
Yeah I seen you on cribs, that's not what you live
Man  I know your babies mom
Why you dodging your kids?
Yeah I make big money, yeah I drive big cars
But I can do that dog, I'm a movie star

[Hook](x2)




[Bridge: Michael Jackson & Kanye West]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
Yeah, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For 40 days and for 40 nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
(Do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge 2]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey

[Hook]

(Uh uh, yeah yeah yeah, number one)

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean... Billie Jean...
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean...




I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah I'm 'bout Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would drive me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been

Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four Five Seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Tell yo dickheads I'ma go nuts (woo)
Niggas told me to grow up (huh?!)
So I matured to a V10 (skrrt, skrrt)
I'm in a vacant lot doin' donuts (skrrt, skrrt)
There go my ego, Leggo my Eggo
Never sip syrup, shout my nigga Scooty
Y'all don't want beef, let us know he can eat that bread
Cause he pushin' that mayo, fuego (Ow!)
Respect when you see him
Boy, last album was a musical museum
Somethin' always lost with you niggas like Liam
Neeson, boy, you better run (yeah!)
Here I come, snortin' glitter, portrait pictures
I don't run with many cause their walk is bitter
Niggas mad at T, where the tall freckled white boys at?
Cause I don't fuck with niggas (woo!)
That's not my homie, that's not my woadies (yeah!)
That's not my team, nigga, they're benchwarmers (fuck'em!)
I am a stormer, I am a trooper (fuck'em!)
I am a Koopa, bring the losses now, you assume as I moved it
I run the business, I do not got time for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' stupid, don't need 'em, don't want 'em
I drop 'em, they're deadweight, them niggas useless
Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news (woo!)
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback
I got a new white one that I worked hard for
So the doors on my car doin' jump jacks (riiight)
My big bro Frankie got a Porsche (huh?!)
My little brother Taco got a Bimmer
If you see 'em around me, they eatin'
We all good, it's like FEMA, but of course

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
Get money, nigga! Get money!
All you funny lookin' niggas, back the fuck up!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, man

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
I wanted to add this
I sit in room with a to do list
Proceed to do and play acoustics, you
Sit around and look at me feelin' foolish
Rollin' up and make excuses, fuckin' losers

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck them niggas! Ayy man, ayy man!
Ayy I just got one mothafuckin' question
Why the fuck these niggas wanna look like me now?
Why the fuck these hoes wanna fuck a nigga like me now?
Why the fuck these niggas frontin' like niggas ain't been invented the swag they runnin' with?
Why the fuck is niggas actin' like niggas ain't the originators of this shit?
Man, I tell these niggas they can die and suck a dick!
How was that? Cool?




[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, right now
We wanna bring forth to the stage
A very special guest
The undisputed Made Men

[Verse 1: Antonio Twice Thou]
Ayo don't run up on me, wit that rah rah
Smoking lah lah
I'll blow holes in your dada, you nada
I toke a lotta, choke a lotta... from Havana
And stroke skins in the Ramada, I open drama
Told the llamas in my bomber, word to mama
Ready to war in pajamas in these cold streets
I hold heat. I'm a known thief, with gold teeth
Matching custom made gold jeep
Chrome rims, brown Tims, plus a Benz getting flown in
Equipped with shit to make domes spin
You average, we set standards
Trend set, Made Men wet
Anything moving in front of the TEC
With immaculate, accurate aim, crack the game
With a home run, blasting lames with they own gun
It's on, son. My air crowd's got the spare gat
By the gear shaft, quick to clear cats out like tear gas
The wrong one since a young gun
Not an unsung hero with a fitted sombrero
Gimme arms' length. Bomb threat phenomenon, shit
I get the dough cause I want it (that's right!)

[Chorus: Benzino]
Cash from mad grams make it alright
While we push big cars under moonlight
Be those 20 inch mirrors on Mercedes
Nickel nine for those niggas acting shady
Never ever turn my back on my Made Men
Nigga when its time to set it, just say when
But for now we gonna ride like it's do or die
And when its all set and done its just you and I
(you and I, you and I)

[Verse 2: Mr. Gzus]
C'mon, let the game break, g
Even though it's the grain cause of Made Men
Selling drugs with pistols just to get papes
211 your spot, leave you 187
And a pen and pad being my only weapon
Approaching Armageddon, care to learn a cautious lesson?
Second guessing in this life can be costly
When the bangs broken leave a nigga frosty
Frozen stiff from the 40 mil mega lift
From a game played out like a Sega gift
For the streets, shit take a major whiff [inhalation]
Of the high potent seedless cannabis sativa, I believe that
It takes a lot of pain away, I do this everyday
It gotta be a better way, looking for a rider
Tomorrow been suffering the sorrow
Took the heat, took the lead, now you follow
Every road has two paths
One's fun and laughs, opposite of blood bath
I choose the better half, run with the cheddar staff
Avoid the garbage, recycle the trash
To get track cats slapped up and kidnapped
Cause we rapping don't mean it can happen
See the gats clapping? At ease. You been cleared from the homicide
Nothing to fear cause we here, just you and I

[Chorus x2: Benzino]
Cash from mad grams make it alright
While we push big cars under moonlight
Be those 20 inch mirrors on Mercedes
Nickel nine for those niggas acting shady
Never ever turn my back on my Made Men
Nigga when its time to set it, just say when
But for now we gonna ride like it's do or die
And when its all set and done its just you and I
(you and I, you and I)

[Over Chorus and outro to fade out: D Quest]
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
Let's ride
Where my dogs at?
That keeps us alright.

It happened on a Thursday

"See, he don't know what he's doing to me
Got me feeling all type of crazy ways
Got me feeling like uh
Owww! Ooooo Oooooo"

I’m doing more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
‘Cause did I mention, you're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'
‘Cause my lovin' feels like ooooooo
But you don't know my name
And I swear it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Ohhh

But you don't know my name
You don’t know it
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo

Will you ever know it? My name…yeah…yeah…yeah
Thank you

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (A lifestyle)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got, and that's a given

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They like, "Pablo—"
"Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
"Why do you know every single bitch that I know?"
"Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?"
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (Perfect)

[Chorus: Drake]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)




[Intro: Caroline Shaw]
*Harmonizing to rhythm of chorus*
Hello my only one
You keep on

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Hook: Kanye West]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Hook: Kanye West]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Hook]
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...




[Intro]
Man Mel, G
I gotta pour my heart out on this track you made
It just made me feel like I had to say something
Like what I'm going through right now
I'm Kanye-to-the and the Roc is in the building right now
Feel me on this

[Hook]
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)

[Verse 1]
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley, they gon' call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with Jay-Z, yo
For the tracks, charge around 800 C-notes
So glad I ain't take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repo'd
I broke up with my girl today around 3-0
My man said, "Let's call some girls that we know"
Sometimes I wanna say, "Fuck my bitch"
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin' chick sucked my dick
It wouldn't make me not feel so sick
Just because, they came over to cheer me up
Smoked, drank, and yeah we fucked
But nothin' that they did could've been enough

[Hook]
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)
Oh, oh
I'ma need to take a hit of that dro
I'ma smoke l never smoked before
And bring some girls that's really down to get low (to the wall)

[Verse 2]
Now this weed, drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me, that's an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin'
Girl, told you don't leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon' leave your ass
But when he get low, he gon' need your ass
If he cryin', callin', bawlin'
Y'all've been together too long for all this name callin'
Y'all'll be back together in a day or two
Yeah we be makin' up but when we makin' up
All we're makin' up is the truth
Damn, I know she love me, oh
But I'm in the Matrix and I'm feelin' I'm Neo
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah
But I'm a Gemini that's bossy like a Leo
And sometimes I don't know what side I'm on
I just know this Patrón got me gone
And I've done fucked up so bad that I can't go home

[Hook]
Oh, oh
Let me call some, call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean the bougie ones from before, 'fore
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low (to the wall)
Oh, oh
I'ma need to take a hit of that dro
I'ma smoke like l never smoked before
And bring some girls that's really down to get low (to the wall)




[Verse 1]
She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla, so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed

[Hook]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

[Verse 2]
Fear in her chest her face in tears
Had her man's back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through stumbling fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

[Hook]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

[Verse 3]
The judge yelled for order the court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession, she screamed

[Hook]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

[Verse 4]
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

[Hook]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

[Outro]
You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse
Please let me testify, please let me testify

When you know you should be going through the motions
We don't got no time to waste, whoa-oa-oa

This the shit that make you wanna wow (Wow, wow)
And I really think I'm on that king shit
Make you wanna bow down (Bow down)
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I lost it now

Girl, I'm feelin' like I'm lost and found
'Cause I'm so up and down

[Refrain: Post Malone]

[Intro: Nas & Puff Daddy]
Escobar season begins
Ayo, we ain't posin' for no pictures in 2018
Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Nas & Puff Daddy]
Black Kemet gods (yeah), black Egyptian gods (let's go)
Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense
Show gratitude in the presence of dominance

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Nas]
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
To Catholics…

[Verse 2: Nas & Puff Daddy]
To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)
John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it
Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved
Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation
(Fuck your proclamation!)
SWAT was created to stop the Panthers
Glocks were created for murder enhancement
For hunting men, circumstances
Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
"Am I good?" he ask, thinkin', "But is he testin' you?"
(Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things
Make you pussy, make you a snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Puff Daddy]
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they're scared of us
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
See, we don't care about what you think about us
I think they scared of us, yeah
What you say about us
I think they scared
You bitch ass, yeah

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Ayo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us
That's why they feel uncomfortable around us
'Cause of our greatness
You're lucky God made us compassionate
And forgiving
Pssh, man, they scared of us, Nas
We see that bitch in your eyes

[Intro]
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen

[Interlude: Shawty Redd]
Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Yo, Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You like that, don’t ya? I wrote it myself, by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish, but I picture myself gettin' paid
And you might catch pneumonia, 'cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it, now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m tryin' to get paid

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Tryna get saved? (Too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stockin' mask, niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I’ma let all y'all niggas pray for it, my young niggas knockin' off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end, only fuckin' way I’ma pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on, my niggas locked in a cage for
They keep tellin' me to go hard, number one spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more, front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red, "Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin' in my lane for, not knowin' that it’s a landmine?
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze, throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood, solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers, I’ma flood, black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine, rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin, under bright lights, where do you belong?

[Chorus: Shawty Redd]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Amen, how many people do you know hatin’
On your downfall, sittin' there, waitin’?
When you shine, I don't know what they gon' say then
Everything I do now stadiums
So tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God’s child
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights, uhh
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over, no reason, beat 'em

[Chorus: Shawty Redd]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen 'em come 2-tone like a Saleen (Saleen?)
Saleen, yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustlin'
They say they want that dumb shit, well, this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, yeah, now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraordinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it 'cause I lived it' man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”

[Chorus: Shawty Redd]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Outro: Shawty Redd]
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen

[Part 1]
Ich bin grade aufgestanden, es ist Viertel vor 12
Egal, ich hau' dir jetzt in deinem eigenen Viertel eins auf die Zwölf
(Pom Pom Hurensohn!)
Lauf zu Mama, sonst erhältst du von der Faust von K-O-Doppel-L
'nen Schlag auf's Trommelfell
Du stehst vor'm Traualtar, gibst deiner Frau das Ja-Wort
Doch sie antwortet nicht, denn sie ist aufblasbar
Du bist neidisch auf mein' Schwanz
Motherfucker, was kann ich dafür?
Hab' ich ihn nur halb drin sagen Hoes, ich wirke distanziert
Ich besuche deine Stadt, bewaffnet mit 'nem Golfschläger
Und verursache mehr Kieferbrüche als ein Holzfäller
Deine Mom ist lustig, wenn ich zufällig vorbei komm'
Springt sie mir sofort an meine Eier, nenn' es Eisprung
Du hast Homies in der Jury und solltest du gewinnen
Dann höchstens durch Schiebung, so wie beim Sumoringen
Ich bin der Bitcheskenner und Gewichtestemmer im Fitnesscenter
B-O wird gepuncht und ist schwer mitgenommen wie dicke Tramper

[Kollegah imitiert BoZ]
Ey Kollegah, digga, ich weiß du hast mich schon mal gefickt wie ne Bitch. Aber ey ich hab zum Schluss noch eine Bitte so. Ey kannst du vielleicht nochmal so richtig geil abflowen? Geht das klar?
[Kollegah]
Ey für meine Fans doch gerne, pass auf!

[Part 2]
Ich zerficke deine billigen Parts mit der Fist
Und verbrenne deine Mutter mit Napalm Geschütz
Deine Bitch ist auch bei meiner [?] geworden
Und ich hab mit einigen Homies zusammen ihr Grabmal bepisst
Pass auf, ich kille dich zum Beat, ficke deine Bitch
Gib ihr dann paar Tritts, ficke deine Hits
Nigga, du bist weak
Penner, geh mir bitte nicht auf die Eier
Laber mich nicht voll mit "Gib mir bitte Feedback"
Punk, ich amputiere deine Füße und du flehst mich an von wegen
"Nigga, gib mir doch mal bitte meine Feet back"
Ich fick mit deinem Girl Motherfucker
Ich hab das Gefühl, ich bin jetzt in die Ho verliebt
Und kann nicht ohne sie, ich geh Kondome ziehen und komme wieder
Und dann popp' ich sie die ganze lange Nacht zu dopen Beats von Jordan C
Oder von dem Nigga Timbaland
Bitch, ich trage meine Timbalands
Viele nennen mich den deutschen Twista
Doch ich selber nenne mich den deutschen Killa Cam
Ich kille deine Family mit einer Gilloutine, Nigga
Bis du ganz alleine bist und keiner dich mehr lieb hat
Nein, ich gebe dir kein Feature, weil ich busy bin ich ficke grade Gina Wild und laber dann wie zwei wie Nina Sky, Nigga




[Intro]
(Nigga, uh)
Yeah, huh (nigga uh)
Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?
See what I see
(Nigga uh, nigga, nigga, nigga uh)

[Verse 1]
At the age of fourteen, introduced to coupes
Learnin' how to seduce niggas takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, in 9th grade flauntin'
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'high price' life
While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them
With mo' fame than them, they know who they are
This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke
You was my sister, we used to dream together
How we could make it real big, do our thing together
Huh, Thelma & Louise together, remember them days?
Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak
Went our seperate ways, seperate lives
Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game
About to forfeit high price life, I can't afford it

[Chorus]
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

[Verse 2]
Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams
Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap-thing
Age 4 in my mother's shoes, swore I could sing
And even as a little girl I was doin' my thing
Uh, confused, I ain't asked to be born
Nigga so dumb, shoulda used a condom
Ask mommy every day, when daddy gon' come?
But he never showed up
I would pimp for them, became demented, then men?
Resented them, just the scent of 'em made me hurl
'Specially the baller ones tryin' to buy me with pearls
All I needed was love, all I wanted was love
Lack of love had me fallin' for thugs
The niggas who ain't care, just like Daddy
If he ain't care, why should they?
For this 'high price' life, it's the price I pay

[Chorus]
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

[Verse 3]
All my girls cross the world that feel what I feel
Hearts bruised, then been way I been, keep it movin'
Let him do his thing, I'm the one he's lovin'
I'm here to show ya'll, havin' a kid ain't meanin' nuthin'
That ain't keepin' him, 'specially if he in love with another chick
Then you stuck with the 'babymother-shit'
Don't be lovin' niggas more than yaself
Let 'em roam, a dog always finds his way home
Shit, ya'll don't wanna take my place, catchin' cases
Spit in faces I never seen falsely accused
While some say it's rude
But if I was a dude, they all be amused
But I'm a woman, so I'm a bitch, simple as that
Double-standards, call him a Mack, call me a ho
Say I'm in it for the dough, but tell me
What the fuck he in it for?
Wanted it all, now it's all mine
Loneliness, sorrow, confusion and pain
Nightmares, headlines, "Rapper found slain"
If it wasn't for my moms I'd drown in this pain
Now ya'll see what it's like, ya'll don't wanna be me
Cuz it ain't always what it seem on TV
Shit, but this is my '9 to 5' ya'll
Sometimes I wanna slit my wrist and end my life ya'll

[Chorus]
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?




[Verse 1]

I always knew the grind, I never had to brag when they saw me doing fine, cause I don’t like to boast but, I might be close to my dreams that I see where all we do is rhyme, but y’all be too inclined so I’m raising the stakes, maybe going line for line when I’m facing the greats, I’m who I wanna be cause I made some mistakes, all you rappers are wannabe Wayne Jay Z and Drake’s pick the pace up, you feel it in your face when the bass pump, rewrite history, they can never erase us, I may just, risk it all it’s obviously dangerous, I know that I’m the go to person who they trust in one take, I get it done great on the first try, it’s like a untamed gun range when the words fly, you want some good advice here’s a trigger pull it twice you rappers looking like chump change when I swerve by, pump fake, then crossover bitch I’m like A.I, I’m looking birds eye view told you I stay fly, I put my soul in this but my name isn’t De La, I know they all bluffing it’s no wonder why they lie, gave my all in it I’m evolving like Kdot, promise I can’t drop, it’s a bomb when the flame drop, stay locked in like I️ forgot where the keys are, I’ll never depart going hard every three bars, I drive a mean car now they all wanna be Mar$, I️ know I️ dropped out but I️ still got my street smarts, retards we will never be in the same class, these bars are my ring of fire like J cash or a grenade flash propane in my brain mass swear ima make stacks till I’m driving a Maybach, it’s time to face facts now I’m taking your lane fast, my flow so wavy now I’m making a great splash, writing fire tracks, I inspire that, fighters type of mentality you biters all try to jack, now i attack every line facts and acquire stacks, so turn the amplifier up higher the choirs back, entire rap verses synchronize like a symphony, my rhyming has purpose spitting wise like epiphanies, I’m killing mad serpents that i found in the grass lurking, my lines are past perfect this is why ima real emcee, bring out the black hearses killed the game it’s a funeral, I know the worlds ugly but I’m making it beautiful, don’t let em’ try to change you stay indisputable always try to be yourself that’s one thing I want you to know

Uh, uh, uh, yo

Harlem World gon' take your bitch
Harlem World is the place to be
This M-A-Dollar Sign-E

[Stase]
Yo, hold up keep it steady
Y'all chicks ain't really ready
Y'all sweating Stase already
And I ain't pushing a Chevy
I ain't even lyin', I ain't even sign
People want my back
Yo, what's up with that?
See, running out the mouth gon' get your face slapped
Tell me do you like what you see
Is it tight as could be?
No, Mase ain't writing for me
And I have no desire to be
Or have fake chicks rhyme wit me
Uhh, you ain't my man, you ain't down wit me
You ain't certified Harlem World get from 'round me
And Mase my big brother thats why you surround me
You could drop me off the same place you found me
Cuz it won't be long before you have to crown me
If I'm chicken, I'm jerk chicken and we're flickin'
And men die with chicks, so am I worth kissin?

1 - I hate the ones that don't suck no (ow)
I hate the ones who date them dumb chicks
I hate the ones who wanna get you for your dough
Wanna be a (ow)? Be a (ow), on the low

I hate the ones that don't suck no (ow)
I hate the ones who date them dumb chicks
I hate the ones who wanna get you for your dough
Wanna be a (ow)? Be a (ow), on the low

[Loon]
Yo, it's only right that you hold me tight
Even though we fight, because the dough be like
When the dough be right
You know we havin a ball
Sippin on cristall and all
Chicks smile and all
Yo' dealing wit fishkill and oil
Ice on the wrist dial and all
But nevertheless, boo there was never a test
That stopped me from loving you best
I'm hypnotized, girl by your hips and thighs
Definitely your lips and eyes
Them chicks can slide
They tryin' to be all in the mix
Your girlfriend ballin' a 6, and holdin' my tip
But boo, there's only room for 2
Until I get the coupe for you
You know how I do
And then you could scoop your crew
And do what you wants to do

Repeat 1

[Naughty]
Naughty, Naughty, Naughty
I went from cradle to crawlin', to a stroller
Way I was strollin' and hopin when I get older
That I be holy
Kicks to camp *** floatin' with Naught'
A boat and a yacht
Was all that I was hopin to rock
As a young kid stacked and eventually learned
That money was made for that
Never meant to be burned
Why lets all get this
Using that 'I murder you face'
I be the youngest nigga pushin' a convertible eight
But thought *** to that they gon' taste this ***
Got some honies to the back so they can chase my dick
When I die they'll be a headstone big as a ***
And a pack of fifty redbones diggin' me up
For the fact, played it back
And I'm tryin' to see me, a house and six floors
And peranhas a week
Got a spouse, deep throats while I'm tryin' to sleep
Lookin' out for B-4's every diamond creek

[Huddy Combs]
But you slow money, cuz it's better than no money
I only crap out when I play with your money
You know Huddy, still sittin' on old money
I only hang wit Mase cuz he keeps them hoes for me
Kick a little bit, but yo I'm no dummy
Your girl love me, so you keeping your girl from me
And tellin' lies, gettin caught in different rides
Wit different guys, stay different in different pops, what

Repeat 1 until fade

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)

[Verse 1]
Okay, I ain't that fucked up, but I'm halfway
We came a long way from the alley
Bad, bad, bad bitches they dressed up
Like it's the NBA draft day
And I bet and I bet that she ain't gon' be that late
For a young, sexy face like me
A young, young, young, sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG ya
Sexy young thing, I might have to ID her
Ooh, damn I got some ideas
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur
Older women be like, "damn, you mature"
I say you the one, but goddamn I got nerve

[Hook]

And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby

I might even speak Italian
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
I be wildin' like I never had a daddy
And the titties paparazzi, they be flashin', god damnit I'm a hottie
Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby
I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick
With a billion dollar pussy
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips
But never ownership, they ain’t on that donor shit
Well, fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit
Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit
I'mma calamari steak that shit
And cop so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit
Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit

Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?

[Hook]
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs

The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like NY, summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up"
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ayy, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood (Welcome to the good life)

The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life!)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)

And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me "baby"
If you feelin' me now
Then put yo hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good!




Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!




[Intro: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Re-Up Gang Pusha
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yes!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Uhh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yeah, yeah)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, uh, for the followin'
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modellin'
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing, cause when you chase the pussy
It’s a sin, but if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
CyHi! Yeah! Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m runnin through them circles boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings so trust me, dawg, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothin’ silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

[Interlude: Big Sean & Kanye West]
G.O.O.D., I do it
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
B-I-G, Sean Don, nigga
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (bitch!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I’m in, that no-smoke sec' rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Yo bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from, quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch, and you don’t want no problems
On some math class shit so check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout




[Verse 1]
In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger, in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert, an oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razor's edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Turn a blind eye
Try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay
Or running away from all this madness

[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end, then let it come
Let it come, let it rain, rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

[Verse 2]
All of my illusions
Could be shattered, in a second
You can thread a needle
With a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice to be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
From the Tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me




[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh-uh, I'm tryna catch the beat, uh
I'm tryna to catch the beat
I'm tryna to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm tryna to catch the beat

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
(Get 'em high)
All the girls pass the weed to yo' motherfuckin' man
(Get 'em high)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
(Keep 'em high)
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
(Keep 'em high)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcohol-ics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her "Why don't you kill me?"
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna fol-low my heart
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
(Get 'em high)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
(Get 'em high)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
(Keep 'em high)
And if you're losin' yo' high, then smoke again
(Keep 'em high)

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Sumeke Rainey]
("You've got mail!") N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26?
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to "call me"
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?)
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high! Owww!

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never-mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it, yeah

[Verse 4: Common]
Yo, yo
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
(Get 'em high, yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
(Get 'em high, mm-mm, uh-uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
(Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
(Keep 'em high)




[Kanye West - Alternative Second Verse]
The brown hero, live from Ground Zero
Machine gun flow, made of ghetto Ross Perot
And this is disestablishmen-tarianism
With my night goggles on, yeah, military vision
And it’s still a very Christian way to think about livin’
When you prayin’ for freedom ’cause your mind been in prison
‘Cause they tryin’ to control every single big decision
You ain’t effin’ the system, then why the eff is you livin’?
Look, dawg, you can cop whatever suits you on
Three-piece, cuff links and the accoutrements
They been feedin’ us ish without the nutrients
So I’m back with another hit to let the truth be known
And your boy still fresh with the Gucci on
Them Italians sure know how to make what the moulies want
And they really can’t take what dude be on
But I be on the same thing ’til you prove me wrong




[Intro]
Ayo CyHi what the fuck bro?
We've been waiting for your damn album for years man
What the fuck is Kanye doing
How about you get the fuck up and get something done
Drop that shit
If I were you I'd stop being a little bitch
Grab an AK, load that shit up, get out there and drag Kanye's ass out

[Sample]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now, softly laying on the ground

[Verse 1]
Hey Ye, do you know what it feel like
To really be signed to you in real life?
Have you ever wrote a song
And you know you about to say something wrong but you still right?
I hope when I'm done that we still tight
But why wasn't I on the cover of the Complex?
You must've seen what I did to Funk Flex
Ya Sean my nigga but I'm coming after Sean next
Sit the fuck down Mr. West, I ain't done yet
While you're in your little Lambo on Sunset
I'm riding with a gun next to me
And it sounds like a little boy playing with a drum set
And it hold a hundred rounds
Cause when you come around niggas quick to gun you down
You'll be found on the other side of town somewhere, nigga
(Softly laying on the ground)
Get the fuck up

[Hook]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
In my life

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Def Jam
OK, everybody on the fucking floor
You and you by the double doors
That was three shots and it holds 15
So that means I got a dozen more
Now that everybody's on one accord
I'ma tell you what I'm coming for
I want a new million dollar deal on my pub
In the pretty brick house like the Commodores
Oh now everybody's getting kidnapped
Take you back to your crib while your kids nap
And if your wife walk in, start screaming in my ear
Then the bitch is getting bitch slapped
I'ma make it look like a mishap
Cut the TV on so they won't hear this shit clap
And I've got two guns, they gon' think it's suicide
Cause you shot yourself with this strap
(What the fuck CyHi what are you doing this for?)
Cause nobody want to listen to the kid rap
OK, my nigga Pusha shit snap
Nah I'm lying man that shit's crap
OK, Teyana got a fat ass
But she won't let nobody in the clique tap
And there ain't gon' be no new Yeezy album
Cause he in the the trunk with his mouth taped and his wrists wrapped
*mumbling* Shut the fuck up nigga! Shut the fuck up!

[Hook]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
In my life

*Alarm blaring*

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Anti lame nigga, take your girl like a pain killer
Just saw a picture of your first baby mama, look like a train hit her
Can't finesse me, I'm the finest, AKA, it's your Highness
I don't know if she got a snort habit or the bitch got sinus
Pyrex tried to sign us, bakin' soda tryna sign us
Got a red stove and a gold fork, shit lookin' like the Niners
Told shawty, you a minus, and I say it out of kindness
Cuban links change the climate, dick tall, she can climb it
Sold so many damn bags, I coulda went diamond
Watch, wristband diamond, on my neck look diamond
Simon says nigga stop takin' my shit, nigga, start rhymin'
4 rings like an Audi, hotel suite, cloudy

[Chorus: Yo Gotti, Kanye West & Quavo]
Cubans on me like I'm Castro

Dope money, Pablo
Astronaut, take off

She gon' snort her whole damn face off




Chorus (Syleena Johnson):
A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down
A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down

Kanye West:
Man i promise shes so self conscious she has no idea what shes doing in college that major that she majored in dont make no money but she won't drop out her parents will look at her funny. Now tell me that ain't insecurrr. The concept of school seems so securrr. Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr. She like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of airs cause her baby daddy dont really care. Shes so precious with the peer pressure,couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexus. She had hair so long that it looked like weave then she cut it all off now she look like eve.

Then i spent 400 bucks on this just to be like nigga you ain't up on this. And i can't even go to the grocery store without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team it seems we living the american dream. But people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things for the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us,floss cause they degrade us,we trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper look how low we'll stoop even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe

Chorus:
Kanye West:
I say fuck the police thats how i treat em. We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom. We'll buy alot of clothes when we dont really need em things we buy to cover up whats inside. Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth thats why shortys hollering "where the ballas at". Drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack and a white man get paid off of all of that. But i ain't even gonna act holyer than thou just fuck it, i went to jacob with 25 thou before i had a house and i'd do it again cause i wanna be on 106th and park pushing a benz. I wanna act ballerific like its all terrific i got a couple past due bills won't get specific. Got a problem with spendin before i get it. We all self conscious im just the first to admit it

Chorus:
Till fades out




[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Yeah, 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days ‘til Friday
I’m tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

[Bridge: Rihanna]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been

Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Rihanna]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (mhm)
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want

[Video directed by Inez and Vinoodh]




[Intro]
Plain Pat, what up?

[Verse]
I've always been the same since back in the day
Always felt like we should get paid
To be on magazines or we get played
Why did he say it? I don't know, ask Gabe
Now I'm on the magazines where the roses are
Poppin' champagne and that Rosé Don
Won a few awards then we went on tour
And yup in my bag a whole bag of porn
Magazines hate him, then they love him
Then they hate him (we hate him)
Fuck it, what to say then? (fuck it)
Cover of The Fader (yeah)
Now I'm on my way up (Now I'm on my way up!)
Now you want me say what? Huh, you want me say what?
I be talking my shit so I guess I'm an asshole
They be kick and pushin' like Lu Fiasco
And I guess every time I'm just gon' get in that mode
Suck up to the press, I guess I missed that boat
I did an interview with The Rolling Stones
Read the interview, man, the whole shit wrong
Far as this shit go, you know the way I wanna glow
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
You know you know you know, you know
You think that you know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but I'm right here
You think you really know, but you have no idea
And I'm gon' be the same my whole career, yeah
I'm gon' stay the same my whole career, you know?




[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (This shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Santería!

[Refrain: 070 Shake]
Ya te vas a la mañana (Mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—
Ya te vas a la mañana (Mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santería!

[Refrain: 070 Shake]
Ya te vas a la mañana (Mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—




[Intro: Kanye West]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got 'em, Young Carter
On the A-team if it's in alphabetical order
Used to daydream about Benzes and Porches
And by 18, I had a Benz and a Porsche, ha!
I'm so used to stuntin' on y'all
So tired of ballin', excuse me if I yawn
Ha! But I know what I'm doing
Out the window of the jet, you see L.A. like a Bruin, ha
New coupe, foot to the floor
Weather man make it rain, turn sugar to snow, you know
Ha! But watch how you speak
Cause in the street you can't trust every smile you meet, heh
And you ain’t important as the new edition is
Ralph Tresvant, ooh, they so sensitive
And it's the remix, baby!
And I'm a knock it out like Felix, baby, haha
God damn I'm fly
And my troop so cool, I don't have to lie
Hop in my car and go Kanye West
With my groovy new Louis Vuitton Damier vest
Ha! Yeah, let 'em hate though
I'm on my way to the bank, LMAO (wassup?)

[Hook: Kanye West]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's one of the best to touch microphones
That'll spit the kind of shit to put the earth in a type of zone, like
To make 'em laugh or make 'em cry
Bring a life into existence or cause you to die
Now when I was a shorty and when my mom called me precious
I realized I'm outspoken and every word was infectious
I'm sayin', Mommy said God'll bless us
No matter the difficulties or how much it would stress us
I'm sayin', no matter how hard I try
To understand if I behave that I'll see God when I die, man
These words'll dawn on me, why?
Cause no one came back from death to say if it's truth or it's lies
See the point that I'm makin' is that she knew I was blessed
And comin' to life as a legend, the man of best in the flesh
I kiss my mother, countin' figures
Thinkin 'back on when I used to tell niggas, they sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always pray to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Learjet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number
Cause when I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "O"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars)
I'd cop more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
“Wait 'til  get my money,” everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything I wrote
Yeah, hey mama they can't hate him
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]




[Hook]
That new Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back they don't like me though
Why? I can tell you 'bout stupid hoes
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

[Verse 1]
Cuz I cut a bitch
I fuck a bitch, go and find another bitch
And I never trust a bitch
You done touched a nigga 30 times
On some baby mother shit
Talkin' bout you celibate
But you still suckin' dick
This that half a brick, quarter brick
Aye, come and place your order bitch
More of that gutter shit

[Hook]
New Rihanna in the front
Bitches in the back, she don't like me though
Why? I don't know, she might be broke
Why? I can tell you bout stupid hoes
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

[Verse 2]
She know that I have sex with 'em
If you tryin' get lit then go ahead light it ho
What you bitches fightin' for?
Nah, I can't even that’s why you can't sit with us
You need to just sit your ass down
I heard you fucked that nigga well I fucked that nigga too
And they probably didn't tell you that’s what suckers niggas do
And if he had a chance with me he would have never fucked with you

[Hook 2]
Cause that New Rihanna in the front (Bitch)
Bitches in the back, they don't like me though
Why? Side piece 'bout to let wifey know
Why? Thirsty hoes is tryin' get chose
Why? I bet she don't act stupid though

[Bridge]
Cut that bitch in the bathroom
Cut that bitch in the bathroom
I cut that bitch in the bathroom
I cut that bitch in the bathroom
I bet you need to quit playin', quit playin' with me bro

[Outro]
Got a nigga fucked up up in here
You know I'm sayin?
A bitch say she don't like me, you ask her why, she go
“I don't know,” just like some shit stupid bitches say
KnowImsayin?
(Look, I can't even deal with this shit right now. This bitch is crazy, she must have lost her fucking mind. I'm tired of going back and forth with this ho. What the fuck? I can't even deal. Who the fuck does this bitch think she is?)

[Intro: Betty Wright]
There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Big Sean]
All I want's 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

[Verse: Big Sean]
Only real niggas so I know that you still gon' be absent
I feel like I'm the black Brad Pitt when I wake up to fuckin' an actress
We just shot a movie last night on the couch and I swear that that shit is a classic
If I want it, I need it, I need it, I have it, hit so much it's a habit
I'm greedy, I'm greedy, man fuck it, I'm greedy
Her titties so big that I nicknamed them DeeDee
I know that the devil is callin'
Man fuck that weak-ass nigga, let it keep ringin'
Right now I'm connected with Jesus, on threeway with Yeezus
We just signed a treaty, I'm on the couch like "Free my niggas!"
But niggas cannot get a freebie
If I'm in the field then you know that I TD
Overtime, all the time, man I repeat it
I need some good pussy and Posturepedic
Stressin' so hard think my hairline receded
I say how I say and I feel how I feel
And I won't take it back, it's no need to recede it
You stuck on a bitch?
Well I stuck to the script all my life, ain't no need to re-read it
If you got my email, you's a millionaire
If you got my cellphone, you's a realionare
I ain't been home in months but bitch I'm still the mayor
That Detroit nigga gettin' married but I'm still a player

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh




[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace

Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong

But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry paddings
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)
He padded hisself the rap J.F.K., you wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice
Cause the gat that I clutch got a little red light
Need a light?

[Hook]
To smoke that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek always smoking that la-la-la
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Hook]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami

[Jay-Z]
We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a ten, chances you're with him
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you CB-4
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!

[Hook]
Still smokin that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek still smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. baby, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Hook]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami

[Verse Three: Kanye West]
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'mma play shy brother
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
Then I'mma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential
That have fun breakin her fundamentals
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
And Rémy and weed, 'til she higher than helium

[Hook]
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby
C'mon!

[Hook]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
WHOA, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami

To Yooou, you know? This..if you don't, y-you can't get wit the indoor pool, the outdoor pool, or lil music studio thing, the little bowlin thang, ya know what im sayin? Hm, this is yours. But chu don't like that, then fiiine man. You can leave. You can allllways leave. I'm not holdin you here"

Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(Gangsta, ugh!)

1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor aisle
She said, 'i hope its not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, "whooa!"
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson is

Martin again:
Fuck you. Fuck yooou. I on't give a fuck whatchu have. This little indoor-indoor, outdoor pool, little bowlin alley. Material buuullshit. It don't mean shit. It don't make what's in the muthafuckin heart"

(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)

2nd Verse:
Hol' up, wait a second man
That's that thrift sto info
That's sauce again
Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the golf courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly

The way this relationship should go if you know me
I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why
How on the low I push jet-skee's so I
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat. Why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
What the problem is?!?!?

Martin again: (audience laughs & applauds) "Why you actin like this? But letchu have some fly shit. Some nice beautiful shit. (Gangsta) They act like they gon leave yoou. You can tell em look here, Ya know. I'm tired a arguin"

(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)

Last Verse:
Man boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'
A nigga I was wit chu before the cheese
So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'
I bet that she'd be a:
AR-GU-IN-G, Please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm gettin spins on
WU-KR, Cin-ci-nat-ti
You think I get my voice so deep
Like WU-KR, cin-ci-nat-ti
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this...

(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it




[Intro] (T.I.)
Want to be your man, please...tell you why
(I know what y'all thinking)
Doop doop doop doop doop doop
(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)
(I wish this nigga make his mind up)
Can't live my life...tell you why
(All my niggas man we gonna have be 21 bout this shit you know)
Oh baby, oh baby
(We gonna step out the track for one sec, one sec)

[Verse 1]
Now what I got to say, seal with a kiss
Know I can't be your man why I feel like this
What I need with a woman when I live like this
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
Set times to the side just for us to live it up
Walking out of Ralph Lauren, purple label linen, yuh
It's hard for me to discuss what I had vision for us
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus
So what if I got a pass, labelled a dirt bag
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets
A part of the package, but still far from a marriage
It's easy to lose balance when hearts just start carin
With the attractions apparent, its hard to stop starin

[Hook]
Hey baby let me tell you sumthin, come here I need to tell you sumthin
(Tell you why)
Hey shorty let me tell you sumthin, wanna talk need to tell you sumthin
(doop doop doop doop doop doop doop)
Lil mama let me tell you sumthin, I wanna tell you sumthin
(Can't live my life...without you)
Hey baby let me tell you sumthin, Shorty I've been meanin to tell you sumthin
(Oh baby, oh baby)

[Verse 2]
If I can get a little bit of your time, shorty
I got some shit I want to get off my mind, and I know
You get enough of niggas hollerin ya fine (hey
Ask...ask ya friend man, man I got this)
Introductions seem to bug you, them partnas of mine
My bad, I know you think I'm probably lyin
Then I'mma stop to conversate, relates all of ya time...man
Look, but half of that shit is all in ya mind
Say you should follow your heart and I'm followin' mine
But anyway, when I see yo' face
Im thinking three or four days in Montego Bay
At the Half Moon, but I know she gon' say
I already have too many hoes, I know
But if I had you, all the dough I'd blow
On eleven karat pink stones trillion row
I wanna be the reason why you showing ya teeth
Without a worry in the world when you rolling with me

[Hook]

{*Roger Troutman's - "I Want To Be Your Man" plays*}




[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)




[Mase]
I'm in party mode now, uhh, you don't stop
C'mon, with the, with the, c'mon
D-Dot, c'mon

Chorus: Mase

Is it you? (Y'all the ones the ladies love to touch)
Is it true? (Y'all be wilin' in the club too much)
Is it you. . . (Made Men, Made Men)
Is it you or is it déjà vu?
Is it you? (Y'all the ones with all the money and all)
Is it true? (Y'all the ones that show the honies a ball)
Is it you. . . (Made Men, Made Men, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Is it you or is it déjà vu?

[Antonio Twice Thou]
Yeah, two thous', new styles, fly as fuck for days
Fry chocolate thai, high as shit for days
Benz 6, V-12, 19's for shoes
Men stick with a team known to squeeze the uz'
Cute girls, jewels, whirlpools and champagne
I ran game, Made Men's on they brain
Aficionado, cigars and Henny bottles
Frijole corazon gatos with hot Glocks though
Twist you like a braid, canary glaze that's made
Baguettes don't shine? Then get it appraised
Perform for MCs with Bentleys and M3s
Burn bomb trees with mamis, sit under palm trees

[Cardan]
Some niggas talk like P Cardy, won't grab three shotties
Let off three bodies, platinum three parties
I move quicker than half of the niggas that's witcha and
Move swifter than cats who Jack the Ripper so
When I say check this, respect this
If you ain't with me and Made Men, get off the guestlist
You see I'm from a place where it's nothing but beats
Nothing but cee-lo where pushers pay the dice off defeat
I got the Rove' out the shop, take the Chrysler off the street
Too much light and too much heat, pick a fight with these freaks
Got a hundred Harlem brothers that'll daze y'all crew
But this is the remix to the déjà vu

Chorus

[Mr. GZUS]
Je-sus with Mase, pass hay, watch us blaze it up
If you don't give a fuck, take your hands and raise em up
It's the knock-right, hit from D-Dot got
Everybody bouncin, steamin up ounces
Ain't no beef, just liquor, and reefer that's cheap
It's cheat or defeat, your girl is quicker to leave
I wanna know can she do dat - if it's you, true dat
Meet me in the back after this track
International, money magnificence
To go against this, I think you know the consequence
I rock Kangols, my link dangles
Got more Cash than Tango, from my mad flows, you know?

[Big Pun]
Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo my shit is fatal, one blow, I make your chin to-ma-to
Don't make me run up in your crib and kill what's in the cradle
I'll make you wish you was dead, push a brick through your head
Rush my clique through your set, suck my dick, lick it yeah
You the worst I ever heard, cursed with severed nerves
And my words to every verse like feathers to a bird
Rhyme compatible, my nine'll rip the spine outta you
Why should I battle you? You couldn't define one parable
I'm thug animal, Hannibal Lect', real cannibal
Eating that ass like fire and gas, my shit's flammable
Frightening in fact, you know niggas is biting my raps
Writing exactly the same like they reciting my back
Niggas carbon copies, always mocking my shit
But can't nobody stop me, get up on top of me dick
It's about to get thick, and I ain't with getting caged in
But I'm a Made Man so I'll be ought by the A.M. -- what?

Chorus 2X




[Intro]
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

[Hook: Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (lights, lights)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

[Hook: Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (lights, lights)

[Outro: Dwele]
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know?
Flashing lights, lights, lights
What do you know? Know
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights, lights, lights…)




[Produced by: Kanye West]

[Intro: Consequence + Kanye West]
I hope you forget me not
Forget me not
I won't forget you ever, ever
Man I promise
After this remix
Forget Red Lobster
Cause I got reservations at Mr. Chow's tonight
And you can get any, and I mean anything that you want
Cause I'm about to bang 'em in the head with this paper
Word

[Hook: Consequence]
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em

Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, Quence let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Consequence]
It wasn't until I got money, that I became a conscious rapper
Cause now I'm conscious of the fact of who they gon' go after
When they tryna find a back up for a team in the park
So they run up on my car before I can even park
But I guess there's no harm in hearin' out his proposal
But how you wanna stack and we aren't even social?
See this the kind of trash that if I choose to say no to
They gon' trash talk about me like a garbage disposal
And say that I changed like a dress rehearsal
And try to line me up with the intent to hurt you
But that ain't nuttin' more than a test of virtue
Cuz my promise to the hood is that I'll never desert you
For years I was swingin' at air
But then a wing and a prayer
Became the seats on the wing of a Lear
Yeah they kickin' theyself cause they should have stuck wit 'em
It's Cons to the Quence and you won't won't forget 'em uh

[Hook: Consequence]
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, 'Ye let's go get 'em

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When I finally get my first real money
Fuck keepin' it real, I'm gonna act real funny
Why? Cause these dudes try to Sanford and Son me
I, sit there and act like a big dummy
When, A&R's saw what they could get from me
I just do what B.I.G. said, go ahead get money
Had to humble myself just to play these beats
One of my side Geminis just reminded me
About, the two ways how you bein' your contact
They laugh for two days when they heard that Kan' rap
Cocky ass rappers ain't need no contracts
Now they fell off and they need a contract
Ha, it's funny how I got what I got
And I ain't never seen it get quite beyond that
Got a chip that won't quit, a grudge that won't budge
These niggas give you pounds and go in for a hug
Naw homie hold up
Naw dude slow up
Y'all ain't never show love
You ain't never know us
No nigga, no sir
Uh, I gotta bounce here comes my chauffeur

[Hook: Consequence]
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
So if you made that money, boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em

[Outro]
Since we made that money boy

They say don't you forget 'em
Since we made that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Since we made that money boy

Uh uh uh uh yeah
Me and Cass got flows until the beat run out
I told you motherfuckers before we in the house

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was Q-Tip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumblin', fallin' down, I ain't drunk that's my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level ain't at my waist level
I'm fly get on a plane jet lagged already
I'm tired, the Goyard bags is heavy
I'm fire, the flow hard as a Chevy
I told her me like ye, she said she like me, ha
When see me with a CL like Pete Rock
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow they sit me right next to Big
And all these old rappers don't know where the exit is
But but but no buts nigga
What nigga
We fired motherfuckers, Donald Trump nigga
I'm killin' these niggas can't front nigga
Now let's drink to that until drunk nigga

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step

It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patron and tell them that it's on
All the bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
All the bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
Err everybody drunk
Err everybody drunk
And I'm home get the patron and tell them that it's on

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
It's remix time

But then he came home grabbin' the mics and bought rap back to life yea he that nice
I'm rocky like a package of white
You see that ice
Nigga please you never seen canaries that bright
I shine I make it look like day time at night
I could never turn the lights off until I take my ice off
Yellow and white chain yellow and white cross
I been a boss ever since I took my diapers off
I like to floss I can get you and ya wife divorced
Ya'll separate before I take her on a second date
You can speculate who comin' in second place
Cause I got the number one record out check it out
I got my drink n my 2 step
It's on now
November 6 is the day that it's goin' down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
So many shots that I can't see straight
All these women around me cats still sayin he can't be straight
Give me ya girl and some platinum Patron
When she come home you can ask her is me straight
She might smile a lot but she won't speak much
Yawnin' cause last night she ain't sleep much
She won't even talk about what we did
Just smile close her eyes and say yes he is
I'm on my Rick James and it's a celebration
I got a driver so I ain’t drinking in moderation
Neither are you little mama and here's another
Celebrate the return of the hustla

[Hook]

[Outro: Cassidy]
Yeah I go by the name of Buzz
My album be in stores November the 6
It's celebration time
Ne-Yo, Kanye, Swizz Beats, I appreciate y'all comin through doin' what y'all do
Y'all know we made history this time around
This one of the biggest remixes I ever heard
For real for real
This goin down real major
I'm out




Y'all Ready? Phally Phel, Cyssero, Ne-Yo, jeezy, calm down, easy, easy
[Refrain: Ne-Yo]
Keep tellin' me you got a man, but he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing (Phally Phel on the track by the way)
He's showing you the minor things
Let me show you the finer things
Let me (I make my appearance) show you what you've been missing
[Kanye:]
Right about this time, raise your glasses
What's my motivation? That ass is
Start a conversation like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the dj "play Swiss"
Now I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin' again, that's music to my ears
What you think my fuel was for all of these years?
I'm inspired when people don't like me
You keep me writing, so exciting
Man, the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
Just to try the motherfuckers so you chain
Throw some cash, that's cake and icing
I ask her "you blind?" she said "no, just sightseeing"
Maybe that's good, you just ain't found a right thing (yet)
Keep tellin' me you got a man, but he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing
He's showing you (allright) the minor things (uhuh)
Let (Cyssero) me show you the finer things (let me show you something)
Let (uhuh) me show you what you've been missing (If you knew better, you'd do better. You do better if you choose better)
[Cyssero:]
Let me show you what you've been missing
Guaranteed you'll be hooked like fishes
By the fisher man when he goes fishing
Lips made for kissing, body for caressing
Let me caress ya, let me undress ya
I could be your professor, lemme just test ya
I'll be your ultimate sexer, and yes sir
I'ma sex ya all through the semester
Hey, skip the lecture, I wanna get next to
You boo, boo, let me show you what it's like to ride with a G like me
I'll be where they can't go, see what they can't see
I could show you the finer things
I'm too major to know about the minor things (you dig?)
Obviously, you ain't found the right thing yet
I bet your man can't do it like me, check
Keep tellin' me you got a man
But he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing
He's showing you the minor things, (uhuh)
Let me show you the finer (uh) things (uhuh)
Let me (uh uhuh) show you (let me show you all) what you've been missing
We can parler, ball out all day
Yeah, I'm just trying to show you what the song say
Louis Vuitton sneaks, Louis Vuitton lay, Louis Vuitton Don and ridin' with Kanye
What did this bra say? "Those heavy stones on your wrist". She keeps askin how much do my arm weight
I replied back "Boo, never mind that. I'm G4 jet. You ever fly that?"
The Paradise Island I was reclined back
In our bed, when we laying, you won't wanna fly back
You wanna try that, hit the mall and buy that?
But you'll miss out if you decide to sidetrack
I can have you by my side, ma, besides that
Hit it from the side, I took the decide to climax
Chain swing side to side and blind cats
Cyssero, Kanye and Ne-Yo, rewind that
Keep tellin' me you got a man, but he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing
He's showing you the minor things
Let me show you the finer things
Let me show you what you've been missing




[Intro] [Consequence Talking]
You're in a privileged position to learn a thing or two
You got the right to wear something tight and have the time of your life
Come bounce with your boy. Cons

[Hook] [Consequence] (Kanye West)
When you're ready to stop runnin'
Ready to stop frontin'
Ready to pop somethin'
(You got to turn yourself in)
When you're ready to start confessin'
Face the consequences
Then baby come learn your lesson
(You need to turn yourself in)
So would all my sexy ladies
(Come on out with your hands up)
And all my pretty mommas
(Come on out with your hands up)
And if you got a body
(Come on out with your hands up)
This one's for ev'ybody
(Come on out with your hands up)

[Verse One] [Consequence]
It goes whoop whoop
That's the sound of the police
When they catch me goin' beast cause my face is in her teeth
And I'm just like Mr. Cheeks
Hit the Lights, get the Cameras
When we in the streets we can fight or get the hammers
Body or the wrist? also weekend in Atlanta
Came and drop more money on the jewels/Juelz than Santana
Cause that's the fine you pay when you shine this way
If it ain't about no money then that crime don't pay
See I find new ways to slide 'em out they dress
Now they wanna have the boy stuck on house arrest
But instead I jumped bail now I'm wanted in each state
How I record to the boy in me get my release date
I believe these tapes will be worth the misdemeanor
Just to see shorty go work it like Misdemeanor
So follow the ring leader, but don't hurt yourself
I wanna sit back and watch you strip search yourself

[Hook] [Consequence] (Kanye West)
When you're ready to stop
Runnin'
Ready to stop frontin'
Ready to pop somethin'
(You got
To turn yourself in)
When you're ready to start confessin'
Face
The consequences
Then baby come learn your lesson
(You need to
Turn yourself in)
So would all my sexy ladies
(Come on out with
Your hands up)
And all my pretty mommas
(Come on out with your
Hands up)
And if you got a body
(Come on out with your hands up)
This
One's for ev'ybody
(Come on out with your hands up)

[Verse Two] [Consequence]
I'm on highway patrol in a six double O
Let me parole your soul with an O of dro
The way them ice gray Stevies got a nigga profilin'
I'm the one they pull over when they get to profilin'
I did my first bid havin' battles in the back street
Now I got a rap sheet for flowin' over rap beats
Plus my back seat has New York's finest
So you can't tell me nothin' like you glued onto silence
But due to all the violence I keep burners in the mix
Cause I'd be tried by twelve, Cons carried by six
If you followed all the tips received on the hot lines
You can see that I spit and come up with the hot line
But most of these dimes want a man in uniform
And I'm just tryin' to get every dawg in my unit on
So you should movin' off that lame and his cavalry
Cause what the men do on that salary is called police brutality

[Hook] [Consequence] (Kanye West)
When you're ready to stop
Runnin'
Ready to stop frontin'
Ready to pop somethin'
(You got
To turn yourself in)
When you're ready to start confessin'
Face
The consequences
Then baby come learn your lesson
(You need to
Turn yourself in)
So would all my sexy ladies
(Come on out with
Your hands up)
And all my pretty mommas
(Come on out with your
Hands up)
And if you got a body
(Come on out with your hands up)
This
One's for ev'ybody
(Come on out with your hands up)

[Outro] [Consequence talking]
Yeah, word. Me and my homie got you and your girl surrounded
Come out with your hands up. Uh, it's the Cons baby
Now I admit. Now if looks could kill
I-I should be convicted for the kind of chicks I been cuffin' lately
Cause you know I don't pull nothin' but that heat
In and out of town boy
As far as that grand larceny charge
I'm gonna have to get overturned cause on the real...
I didn't steal your wife, I just borrowed her for the night
And that's how it goes when you're rollin' with E.P.C. Word




[Intro: The Dream]
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my Macbook Air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be iChattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxson
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
I love you, girl, girl
You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you
And I just upgraded to 10-80i, hi def just for you

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never seen you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I'll type you a message for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then I load
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Bridge: The Dream]
Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind, shawty
Hey, don't care what you wear
Baby, I wanna see what's under there

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
When you seen the picture cut off the face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, would this be considered our first date?
Yay, this picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And pose in the mag like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian and be a lady addict
You know what's a crazy thing?
A girl would make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty three year old virgin
That's disrespectful, baby, don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby, you up, question mark
And she reply YES-S-S-I-R

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl




[Intro]
And I wanna show you how you all look like beautiful stars tonight
Oh he sounding good!

[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast, and die young

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Livin' fast, now it's all linen rags
Hard-headed, but my top peelin' back
Tinted glass on my '57, nigga wit' a attitude (Me)
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
Let my convertible marinate on the avenue
Mami, that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida rapido
Die young, but fuck it, we flew first class
Turned you to a rich bitch by your first glass
Up in this bitch and we lit up like a screen
Every time we hit the charts, niggas shoot up like a fiend
Stuntin' like we printin' money with machines
What you see me wavin', Vacheron Constantine
Like Mike, my Spikes stay all white
Twenty-four karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
I live for the moment, and put a bullet on that (Bawse)
Got the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat
I'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go
Good party over here, everybody over here
You know the word travel fast, everybody know we here
All the bottles over here, even spread it over there
All the models over here, but they swallow everywhere
She came to party like it's 1999
If she died on my dick, she would live through my rhymes

[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast, and die young

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
For all my young ladies ladies that drivin' Miss Daisy
Drivin' me crazy, rock the beat, baby
Hop up out the (ERR!) she eat up the pavement
I don't give a (ERR!) baby, he crazy
I'm back by unpopular demand
'Least he still poppin' in Japan, shoppin' in Milan
Hoppin' out the van, screams from the fans
"Yeezy, always knew you'd be on top again!"
And we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King, Junior
And I'mma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit so disrespectful
You can go 'head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
I mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes
But we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin' "How you do that?"
Uhh, so they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight, I loved every minute

[Hook: Kanye West]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast
And die young, live fast
And die young, live fast, and die young

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Peter Piper pickin' peppers, Rick pitch poems
My leather long enough to keep a thick bitch warm
When that ass is enormous, abs abnormal
And tans in the morning on sands in California
Seems like we gettin' money for the wrong things
Look around, Maseratis for the whole team
Look at Haiti, children dyin' round the clock, nigga
I sent a hundred grand, but that's a decent watch, nigga
I'm gettin' better, cause it woulda leased a drop, nigga
I'mma get my money right, just watch, nigga
She had a miscarriage, I couldn't cry, though
Cause you and I know she was only my side hoe
Uh, I got 'em catchin' amnesia
Time to pull my fuckin' minks out the freezer
See the lynx and you just think, "Jesus!"
I'm hot 'til the day they freeze us
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
I'm multiplyin' my money through different avenues
Took many to war, shook never before
For my mother I applaud Ms. Afeni Shakur
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
Three bad bitches, don't come concurrent
Still, you know the dope won't stop
And if I die today bury me in a dope-ass watch

[Hook: Kanye West]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast, and die young
Live fast, and die young, live fast, and die young

[Intro: Kanye West]
Hip hop, uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
When I fight and you fight, we don't fight fair
So I guess I'll see you in my nightmares
Just remember I made you like my Nike Air
Ye-Yeezys, please be easy
To kill the animosity that's in the air
I'll touch every curve of your body like a Herve Leger
And this wasn't no ordinary love
Our sex wasn't ordinary drugs
It's that crack, that crystal meth
I mean it gets so wet, I had to go in depth
I mean the bitch so fresh I had to go in debt
Ru-running my credit card 'til there's no more left
Uh but that's cool, you wife and I'll be groom
I thought I had a sign a Seal like Heidi Klum
Like Jay and B, like Chris and Ri
But this Christmas you'll be missing me

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
He walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks, he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he thinks about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fought for love through fucked up weather
And she thinking about her life
With no more work, just being a wife
But instead, her love she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she goes to work, plus go to school
Plus fight for love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease to come after pain
She fights for love that's her campaign

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Word, word, yo
I try to stick it out with her through thick and thin
So whether she was thick or thin I was still stickin' in
But like when I left shorty with the rest of my friends
I guess all good things had to come to an end
Instead of moving forward she rather pretend
Because like a tattoo artist, I get under her skin
So she hatin' on the kid and its plain to see
I got her punchin' at the screen like she playin' the Wii
She only think about me when her cash is low
And she heard my name brought up by them classy hoes
Cause she at the same nail shop where Cassie goes
And she up in the club where Vashtie goes
And it start to drive her nuts like pistachios
Cause I guess the g shocked her like a Casio
Then you shot yourself in the foot like Plaxico
And that's too much drama so you had to go




[Intro: T-Pain]
Ahhhhhh! Take a sip of this
Ayyy, let's go {*beatboxing and skatting*}
I want you to feel this beat baby
I'm not tired, let's go! {*beatboxing and skatting*}

[T-Pain]
Listen (whassup?) This ain't the way I wanted it to end
But I gotta go - gotta get missing!
You ain't gotta kick me out, I'll get out my own house
But you still need to get yo' shit together girl

[Interlude]
What do I do, what do I say?
Gotta get us back to the way that we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to?
Shorty you ain't gotta be scared of me, all we need is therapy

[Hook: T-Pain]
Like 1-2-3-4, get the hell up out my door
5-6-7-8, I don't need your sex I'll masturbate
9-10-11-12, you can go to hell all I care
Yeahhhh
Can't do it shorty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you - yeah yeah
Can't do it shorty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you - yeah yeah

[T-Pain]
Listen (whassup?) I know you ain't used to us being friends
But I gotta go - no more kissing!
You ain't gotta go away, but I know I can not stay
Cause you still gonna get yo' shit together girl

[Interlude] + [Hook]

[Kanye West]
Ohhhhh, ohhhh; ohhh you too much pressure doll
You gon' raise my cholesterol
I gotta lower the phone decibels
Just to talk, just a thought
I'mma get a girl with a ass just as soft
You swear men dogs like reservoir and I was Mr. Pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
I was choking you in a good way, good way
Now we in the streets and I'm chokin you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say?
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning Bossip, Perez
Any girl I take out, Mediatakeout, I need a break now
Before I break now (ah ah ah ah)
Show me your Janet Jacksons if you nasty
You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson, classy
Ohhh, why she say that, OUCH~!
Bitch, give me back my couch
On that same couch casting
Now listen to T-Pain and sing

[Hook]

[T-Pain]
BETTER GET OUT MY FACE BITCH!

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 2]
Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Verse 3]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, uh, let's take it back to basics
When shit gets worse, we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as Buck-Fiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan ain't work out, man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

[Verse 2: Common]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?
On the corner




[Verse 1]
Have you ever wondered where'd it all really went?
Wondered if you'd ever, ever find your dreams?
Wondered if you'd ever, ever find your dreams?
Wondered if life had never been that it seems?
Wondered if life is all about the high beams?
The flashin' light, tryin' to get your money right
And you be up all night, tryin' to stay fresh today
Fresh like Mr. West and I'm proudly the best
I been sold on to that guest
Uh, the number one on the charts
Why is that? Because I rap from the heart
What I always did from the start
How I always played my part
Uh, they thought I was so crazy, I got a deal with Jay Z
Now they got to pay me and they looked up lately
I sold a million the first week
'Member when I just sold my first beat
Shit can change and it never stayed the same
Ma, I wonder, I wonder what it would be now
What it would be now, you all standin' in the crowd
Ten thousand, now they hate everythin' now
Everythin' now
Or every single I dropped now, I dropped now
Tryin' do everythin' to keep shit hot now
And the media, they diss me, diss me
They say I'm so fuckin' evil
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, what the fuck do he know?
Cause I'm gonna say my, my shit
And I'm gonna talk my, my shit
And they can suck my, my, my, my
I wonder why they talk so bad
Have they ever had a artist that's so mad?
And they will never realize what they have
Somebody real in the industry
If nobody's real, then I guess it's me
And they, "Freedom," and it's not free
Cause every time I talk freely they attack me
They give me backlash, backlash, backlash
Black, but they can kiss my ass, my ass, my ass, my ass
I say, "Why ask? Why ask? Why?"
Try but try, can they's fly?
Now touch the sky, touch the sky, touch the sky
And I wonder, baby, to can know what it means
What we know
And I wonder, baby, if you know what it means

[Intro]
W-W-W-What is it?

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon, red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead, yuugh!

[Samples]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change, ch-ch-change"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand  grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
Let's get it

[Samples]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"




[Verse 1: Usher]
Baby, I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get it off my chest, 'bout all the shit I've been hearing, babe
I, I thought you were that ride or die, you would never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in your kid, did everything that you wanted me to
Now I'm in the shit about you fronting on radio interviews
Do it make you feel good to lie, even though I know you wanna cry?
If you were gonna tell it, then you should've everything instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say, then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking, it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated, so be it
We need to leave it alone, move on... [call waiting beeping]
Hold up

[Interlude: Usher & Phone Operator]
Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility. Will you accept the charges?
Yes, I'll accept it
What's up?

[Verse 2: Shyne]
Sitting in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
(If you got something to confess to right now, step to the mic, Twista!)
But to give part two of my confessions

[Verse 3: Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Your homie said she saw me, but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've been just telling you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rolling my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field, still looking for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus, I should've kept it real
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up with a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay with me, then it'll be a blessing
No stressing, it'll never be no guessing
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
(Kanye, confess to the people, man)
But to give part two of my confessions

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Damn, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down, that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheating
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
And you know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous, you can't go nowhere
'Cause everytime you go there, there's hoes there
So basically, you and your girl over
And I know when she broke the news
You told her, "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact, like Pat, don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sitting on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back
Way back, way back
Way, way back, way back

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions

[Outro: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do (yeah)
To tell you, the woman I love (uh huh)
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know (yeah)
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this (she probably can't)
And hopefully you'll give me another chance (she might go)

People sayin', "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay

[Verse 1]
I'm like Twista on the rap side
I'm like weave on the track side
I'm Don Juan on the mack side
I'm Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Pac's son
I'm Phil Jackson, this is South Side
They call me Kan', the Louis Vuitton don
But I still might throw on a little (?) on
Same place where the (?) from
Same place I got my flows from
Place I got my hoes from
Talkin', tell me if you know somethin'
Go on 'head, roll somethin'
Bitches get they (?) on when you turn Luke on
Gangstas dance, but they still get they (?) on
Bad Boys II on and she want to go
I'm a cop the bootleg from it for the show
Watch the DVD in the car cause the way a nigga live
We have more TVs in the whip than in the crib
My nigga sells cellphones, we call him Lil' Flip
Welcome to Chicago, my city is the shit




[Hook]
I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou
You go with twenty-five hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow

[Verse 1]
H to the Izzo, did three thou spins in a week
You did a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to The killin' y'all from Chi-Town
How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life
But she still wanna pump the yay
And y'all mad cause y'all not knowin'
Cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up, whether to stop or keep goin'
I got Gs, rock, rock and roll tees with no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that 'Lac, 'Lac?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back, back
While you in that hatchback and tryin' to sell work
And don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studio gon' give you your daps back
And try to get published
And all you get is your ass capped and that’s that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just bought my mom a new car and a house
And that's a lot to say for a college dropout
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
And brought back a couple platinum plaques on the plane
And brought back that soul shit that changed the game
They have no beat, they had to aim the stain, the steel
Got lizards in my R. Kelly strain
They real, man, I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me, "Stick to the beats"
I could've ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
I got killed these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push miracle whips
Gonna save purple haze and some syrup to sip
It have you so right, you drive on the left lane
Gettin' head, crash
Your head hit the window, now that's brain




[Intro]
What y'all wanna do tonight?

[Verse 1]
Provide a new coffin
You don't see murder like this this often

Lock us on, it happen in those, nah, nuhmp

[Refrain]

[Outro]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
Oh, baby, why fall in love and out again?
Do you really ever love or just pretend, oh, baby?
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Why, you're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
Oh, baby, why fall in love and out again?
Do you really ever love, ever love, ev-ever love?
Do you really ever love, ever love, or just pretend
Oh, baby

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uhh.. uhh
Uhh.. uhh

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

[Chorus 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down

[Outro: JAY-Z]
Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down




[Verse 1: Jared Leto & Kanye West]
No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took, you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lied wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
(Heartbeat, a heartbeat, I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground

[Verse 2: Jared Leto]
No matter how many deaths that I die, I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There's a fire inside this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God? Where is your God?

[Bridge: Jared Leto & Kanye West]
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
(Heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me?
(I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me dead?
(You know I gotta leave, I can't stay
I know I gotta go, I can't stay)
Or alive to live a lie?

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You say you wrong, you wrong, I'm right, I'm right
You're wrong, we fight
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Oh, the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane is chasing us all underground

[Post-Chorus: Jared Leto]
This hurricane...
This hurricane...
This hurricane...
This hurricane...
This hurricane...

[Bridge: Jared Leto]
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to live a lie?

[Outro: Jared Leto]
Running away from the night
Running away from the night
Running away from the light
Running away to save your life

[Verse]
What if I told you
The dreams on the other side
The dreams on the other side
Go there with me tonight




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

[Interlude: Kanye West]
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
And I, and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

No, can't stop having these visions

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You got a sister-in-law you'd smash? I got four of 'em
Damn, those is your sisters
You did somethin' unholy to them pictures
Damn, you need to be locked up
Nah, we need a bigger hot tub

[Chorus]
Now let me see you back, back, back, back
Time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max

She got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all of this on Ecstasy

[Verse 2]
You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You remember bad bitches that you smashed? I recorded 'em
She said, "Fuck weed," 'cause she love X
If she suck seed, that's a success
If a girl cum, that's a fuck fest
And we gon' score 100 on this drug test

[Chorus]
Now let me see you back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max

You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all of this on Ecstasy (perfect!)

[Interlude]
Fuckin' 'round—whoop, scoop!
Whoopity-whoop

[Verse 3]
You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
Haaan? Scoop!
You see them escorts? I escorted 'em, scoopity-woot!
While y'all was trippin', I resorted 'em, whoop!
Then I kicked 'em out, I got bored of them, whoop!

[Chorus]
Now let me see you back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse: Kanye West]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Refrain: Justin Vernon]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh, I wanna phone home

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
I heard you need a new fad (A new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (A new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (A new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (A new girl)

[Refrain: Justin Vernon]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh, I wanna phone home




Oh you didn't think we can it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimping to Poppin Tags
From Chunkiest to Slow Jamz, oh baby

Know what I'm saying, come on
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like

Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon, 0-4 Range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me, you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like

Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode em right

You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights, when you take a bath

I'ma get you Jimmy Chew, and Ma Baker bags
I can cop her, a 2000 and 3
Make her smile, when she sees Spre's
I can get you on cd's, and DVD's
Take you to BB's, and PCBG
I can get you in the places, to be into
The people to know or show you things, sticker than to
I wanna be your lover, undercover Don
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can rich your blood
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see you in some Gucci, or Erika Vali
And I bet she gon put a hurt on em, hard in the party
And you know you kill em in the club, we go
You was born to be a po', how you gon sticking fo' do's
And I love you, cause you freaky with the dope clothes
Drop it to the flo', let it go when you roll slow
And I love it, when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me, and have a brother going oh-oh
Girl I love, how you roll me right

[Hook]
She told the DJ pardon me, I need some Swishahouse

(In my life, in my life, in my life) weeell
A Slow Loud And Bangin' c.d., some Screwed Up Click and
A little Sucka Free, cause that's what I need in my life
Yes it is, weell weell

[Chamillionaire]
She say she listens to my music, but she can't get into it
She don't like it regular speed, she like it when they screw it
What I'm fin to do is, call Ron and Watts on my phone
Tell em slow it down, so the ladies can get they grind on
Yellow red or brown tone, call me when your guy's gone
If you gotta shake that lick, them haters get they diet on
She's the type rich men, will give money for some action
Said she's light skinned and, and she'll strip for Andrew Jacksons
Gets excited when, she be jamming them F Actions
Turn the lights off then, and if you wanna get your grind on
Just go pick up that phone, then just get your dial on
Call me up I'll come over, and help you turn your smile on

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
She's calling me, on my phone
Telling me she's feeling freaky, her body's in need of me
Hopping in on my 4's, grabbing my
Chopped and screwed c.d., and my grey T-A-P-E
Y'all know, playas get chose
Color Changin' Click c.d., Michael Watts, OG Ron C
Even your neighbors knew, just what I came to do
They seen the navy blue, choking on things of two
They know it ain't your boo, they heard us banging Screw
Making the headboard bang, while I'm banging you
Giving you a work out, like a trainer
Hit it then I flip you over, to change the view
My sex is a weapon, that's aimed at you
Finish and reload, just like a gangbanger do
You little angel you, that's what your friends think
Cause they didn't see you, sipping on that red drink
Getting drunk, while I hit it on the sink
In the kitchen and I'm switching, I can hit it till the bed sink
You can lock the lock, I'm fin to rock the twat
I'm fin to give your friends, something new to talk about
Fin to give it to you shorty, you gon feel it in your body
Everytime Ron and Michael Watts, chop a spot
I ain't forgot about, the true DJ Screw
Cause if it wasn't for Screw, wouldn't be nothing to do
No claiming red, no claiming blue
It wouldn't be nothing to bang, while I'm banging you, jeah

[Hook]

(*talking*)
She said Koopa, I know you be checking these niggas
But can the ladies get a lil' love, yeah

[Chamillionaire]
I don't discriminate the race, pretty face pretty shape
Shaped like figure eight, she can get a little steak
We can end a date, like a episode of Ricki Lake
Call a couple of your friends, they could participate
Get on my three way, now what is the delay
I pull out the video cam, and show you the replay
I screw you real slow, like a H-Town DJ
We could jam Bun B, and that U to the G.K
And a little Sucka Free, ain't enough for me
Big M-O-E, gotta give me the whole S.U.C., they'll screw it
Money over B.I. to the T-H to the E-S
In the streets shake the peace, everybody respect the streets
Everybody'll shine, from the neck and teeth
Gotta give me the S.P.C., Trae and Dougie D
Free that nigga Z-Ro and that Pimp C, cause thay'll screw it
Girl I got you wet, girl I'll kiss your neck
And I know that the sex, sure to make you sweat
I show respect, to the Swisha vets
And the Screwed Up Click G's, get respect
Lil' O and C-N-O to the E, 'Face and Willie D
Big Pokey, Flip and E.S.G., they'll screw it

(*talking*)
Yeah, slow jam ain't a slow jam
Unless it's a screw jam
Can't listen to it, no other way
Gotta be screwed up
DJ Screw, rest in peace

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I'm saying it like…
"I want a daughter like Nicki, aw, man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no ménages"
I don't know how you saying it but, let 'em hear this




Yo what you doing here huh?
(Hi I thought I'd drop by so nice to see you)
Nice to see you too okay
(It's been too long)
Yeah you can leave now

[Verse 1]
Kanye that nigga with heavy dough
Roll dro and a chevy low
Told a long time ago you can't fuck every ho
Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
Baby don't be scurred, shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin, call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts, look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message, I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Dave with them dumb ass stunts
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course, alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay on the three way
Talking bout (You can't call a bitch on her BDay?)
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Nah nah it's over. (So what you saying?)
Look you gotta bounce. (I don't wanna fuck with you)
(Get your hands off me!) Bitch I ain't touching you
Stop, Chill. Relax. okay
You know what she told me?

[Hook]
I'm never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go

I'm crazy about you
(No you just crazy)

[Verse 2]
You believe this ho, pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show, pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like, "Oh you wash dishes here?"
Pop up in my bathroom, "Oh you take pisses here?"
Listen here we gone need some distance here
(Where I'm gone go?) I don't care, just disappear
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib, then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side, "Kanye you ain't shit"
You believe this bitch? Man, did you see this shit!?
Did she just knock my windows out on my Escalade? (Ha yeah nigga!)
That's a twelve fuckin' hundred dollar estimate
She must've took off all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars
Screaming at the top of her lungs, "I'm never letting go!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like "Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time"
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
(Pregnant with his baby yeah he still getting rough with me!)
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
Girl left a note on my door (Nigga don't ever fuck with me)
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a swole nigga thought that he could lift the van
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

[Hook]

Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
All want a nigga with a chain
Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
Want a nigga whippin that range
Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
Want a nigga banging they brains

[Hook]
Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, that I'm crazy

[Verse 1]
I think it's a couple more things they owe us
I think it's a couple more things they owe us
Billions and cars and weed
And mothafuckin' minks is all that they show us
But we are the owners
I think it's a couple more things they owe us

[Hook]
So don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, nigga I'm not crazy
I'm tellin' you
Don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let them make you believe
That I'm crazy, nigga I'm not crazy

[Verse 2]
See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
We hate each other, screw each other, kill each other
When we can't kill nobody else
See that's the magic of lackin' resources, it works on itself
500 niggas gettin' pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-popped
And North Carolina didn't help
See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
Niggas hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas
Hate niggas, hate niggas, ayy, niggas, ayy, nigga
And I was born in the A, nigga
And my name Ye, nigga, ayy nigga

[Hook]
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't make, make you believe that I'm crazy
I'm not crazy
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let the media make you believe that I'm
That I'm...

[Outro]
See that's the shit I don't like

Real real clean, come and get your rear wheel cleaned
She did what with who? Man I hear things
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things
Up worryin' while she wore her ring
Now she got a fling and where's her ring?
That [?VVS?] is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round
I grabbed her neck and made it hurt to breathe
She said "Security, this jerk could leave"
And uh

[Verse 2: Monica]
So do just what you want anytime that you really like
I put a payment on my place, you'll be sleepin' alone tonight
So don't you come knockin'

[Hook (Monica)]
Knock knock knock, stop knocking
Don't come knocking at my do'
(Don't you come knockin' at, whoa)
Ring ring ring, let the phone stop

[Kanye West {*overlaps chorus*}
Yo this the remix, and I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Or you can call me Louis XIV
By the way cause I dropped out of the fourteenth grade

[Verse 3: Monica (Kanye West)]
I used to be so gone
You were someone I could lean on
My life support system (uh huh)
And I thought I couldn't breathe, ah ah
When you used to leave, yep (ye) yep (ye)
I see you put yo clean on
Big chains, gold teeth, and yo gleam on (Roc-a-Fella chain)
All night wanna be gone
Wanna tell me stay home like I got a [fuckin'] ring on
Now you say I'm not your wife, right right (you like wifey)
So why should I be chillin'? goodnight goodnight (oh)
Now pack up my things for a flight (ok)

So don't come knocking at my do' (aw man)
I got company comin 'round fo'

[Hook (Kanye West)]
I don't want you callin' me no mo'
Knock, knock, knock, stop knocking (yeah)

[Intro: Santigold]
Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn
Brooklyn, we go hard
We go hard

[Chorus: Santigold & (Jay-Z)]
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Go hard)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Better look on map
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' use to
Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Please! Tell me what the name of this shit

[Hook: Santigold & (Jay-Z)]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aw, man—I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

[Hook: Santigold & (Jay-Z)]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)

[Verse 3: Santigold]
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head

[Hook: Santigold]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

[Outro: Santigold]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard




[Intro]
Never would have made it
Never would have made it without you

[Chorus]
You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

[Verse 1]
Finally, I know what I want
I learned from my mistakes and my heartbreaks
The road to hell was paved with good intentions
No matter which way you, no matter which way you take

[Pre-Chorus]
Never truly follow my heart
Made a lot of decisions based on everyone but me
But now, I'm strong enough to let it go
I'm wise enough to take control
My mama told me everything
My mama told me everything I know

[Chorus]
You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

[Bridge]
Stand up, press forward, move on
Don't cry, we'll make it through the night
For sure

[Chorus]
You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

[Outro]
Never would have made it
Never would have made it without you
Mommy?
Yes?
Move forward

(Carl Thomas) "I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the
Way, I'm ghetto"

(Raekwon) Thats right, thats what I'm talkin' 'bout, tell the young boys
Out there man"

(D-Dot) "Takin' it back on some soulful type shit, Hip-Hop in it's rare
Form"

(Carl Thomas) "Spend a dollar on some wine, hand my clothes out on the
Line, I'm ghetto"

(Raekwon) "Now ya'll niggas wanna wear Polo and Hilfiger"

(Carl Thomas) "I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm
Ghetto"

(D-Dot) "We just wanna talk to ya'll, tell ya'll a lil' somethin'"

(Raekwon) "I tell the story for the young black youths out there"

(Verse 1: Raekwon)
Yo, it started out in East New York
Where I grew up, knew how to walk
Favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers
Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar
Starvin' for mine, bust three at ya
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy
Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
That's ya Pops
Still, thats me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out
Three days away from home he stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big
Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
Cop pleaded
What should I do? knock your self off, God succeeded
And the most scariest part? Better have heart
Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Make a brick and get barred
Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black carry-on, ready to die for the family hard
Alcoholic vultures with toasters
Sheep skins on
Leather V Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit
Smoke a bag of wet and set it
The block we deaded
Society wrong, we too black and too strong to prolong
Got my woman with a gun in her thong
It's kinda wild how we livin'
The Devil fall has arisen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders
That's real, cause we need them and they need us, that's wealth for ya
Leavin' on this moment
Meditate, Four in the Mornin'
Nigga you straight.....

Chorus (Carl Thomas)
I got hustlin' on my mind otherwise I'm feelin' fine, I'm ghetto
I like black tint on my car, at the park a Superstar, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

(Verse 2: Madd Rapper)
Born in the gutter
A Black Pops and a Puerto Rican Mother
I kept a stolen whip and razor sharp box cutter
Known from Albany Ave to 98th and Sutter
My leathers was pleathers while ya'lls was butter
Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it
Didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my Dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx
Knowin' all along the shit was wrong
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last
It keeps goin' on, so keep movin' on
Same old story, my Pops left
Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex
With around the way bitches
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps
I stay Brooklyn zoned, underground is how I network
Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts
So pardon my appearance, everythings all good
Nigga I'm just like you except I'm from the hood

Chorus (Carl Thomas)
I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto
(D-Dot - this goes out to all my peoples in the hood, in ghettos all
Around the nation and all around the World, knowhatI'msayin'?)
Spend a dollar on some wine, hang my clothes out on the line, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, doin' two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peak over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

[Outro: Kanye West]
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

[Intro - Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold

With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard

Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 1: Kanye West & (Young Thug)]
For my southside niggas that know me best
I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex
Why I made that bitch famous (Swea)
I made that bitch famous (I made her famous)
For my Chitown niggas that know me best
I feel like Amber Rose still owe me sex (Chiraq)
Why? I made that bitch famous
Not really, but somewhat famous (err, kinda)
All I do is get tattoos and read French Vague
Every bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Who am I to remind you? (What?)
But tell me, who am I to remind you? (Who am I?)
And did you know that the country, Switzerland
It was famous for lakes?
And I think I got my ring from there 'cause it's icy like skates
Nigga, icy like hockey
Cold like a dead body, yeah

[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start (Oh yeah)
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 3: Kanye West + Young Thug]
Nike slave, fit in your place
Don't come out your face
Don't come out your mouth
Don't come out your house
Don't come out the blah
It came out the North, it came out the South
The tally is down
Bumpin' the...
The hate is anony...
The Copacabana...
It made me...
Someone told me...
The world turnin' Black slowly
Where you can call niggas "niggas"
But you better not mention Hitler
So tell me who run the label, where the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us
US!

[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Free like a bird
I just wanted you to know
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
One more time for the Chi-Town
One more time for the A-Town
I bet that money come around if you stay down
I swear, I just came from Europe, my money colored like a clown
Nigga play with keys, Swizz Beatz
Nigga only fuck unique freaks
Still Michael Jackson after all these leaks (what?)
Yeah, bitch, you're still Dirty Diana to me (woo!)
Pop a hundred bottles, I'm the shot caller (ballin'!)
Came up out a hot boy, fuck a baller blocker
Bitches makin' lots of noise like Griselda Blanco
You hit it first and bought a purse and she moved off your blocka' (fool!)
Lick the molly off my hand
Smokin' loud, ambulance
And I was high as hell, I need to come down
Somebody call Tar, I need a Xan
Eat that pussy like a jelly bean
My patna's bigger than a jelly bean
Got a mink on like I'm Hakeem
Got fish filet but we don't fry these
Gold card with a Trojan
Rub the bitch with the lotion
Bitch I'm ballin' like Kobe
Bitch I'm ballin' like LeBron
No, no, we don't broadcast
Pussy nigga gotta show
Monkey nigga actin' like they don't know me
But a lot of monkey niggas owe me

[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know




Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
The only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
We gonna run this town

We are
Yeah I said it
We are
This is Roc Nation
Pledge your allegiance
Get y'all black tees on
All black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds
Ridin' with they dillingers
I'd get more in depth
If you boys really real enough
This is la familia
I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave the other grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma
Six zeros
Dot zero
Here it go...
Back to runnin' circles 'round bitches
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
The only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
Oh
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y
(Who gonna run this town tonight)

We are
Yeah I said it
We are
You can call me Cesar
In a dark Czar
Please follow the leader
So Eric B. we are
Microphone fiend
It's the return of the god
Peace god...
(Auh! Auh!)
And ain't nobody fresher
I'm in Mason
(Ah!)
Martin Margiela
On the tape we're screamin'
Fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquette full the broads
They got a table full of fellas
And they ain't spending no cake
They should throw they hand in
Cause they ain't got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaire's Row

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
The only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-y
(Who's gonna run this town tonight)

It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody trying to get a no homo
'Cause I slept all day
This the life that everybody ask for
Welcome to the fast life
A crash course

We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
On the grind, all the time, be like T-Pain
Who's gonna run this town tonight
(Who's gonna run this town tonight)
It's just who asked without me
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y (We gonna run this town tonight)
Hey-e-e-e-y
Hey-e-e-e-e-e-y (We gonna run this town tonight)
Hey-e-e-e-y (We gonna run this town tonight)




[Intro]
Bom bom bom bom bom

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Verse 1]
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me no curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz somebody cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you Mama

I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
Mama, you know I love you so, and I'll never let you go
And I wrote this song just so you know that when you go

[Hook]
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep

My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

[Outro]
And this life is all a dream
And my real life starts when I go to sleep
My mama, mama, mama

Mack hoes just to get 'em in the doggy position
Put my key in yo ignition and work the kitten
Introduce you to how hustlers livin
Dick and bubblegum is all I'm givin
New whip, new year, new crib to sit in
I'll take ya bitch, make ya bitch make me rich
From major chips, but now you sick
How Stat Quo got dough to flow and 'dro to blow
Yak to sip and wigs to split
'Nuff grip won't slip, be easy
Your girlfriend wants to, please me

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire talking]

[Verse Three: Chamillionaire]
Go get a bigger scale
On a scale of one to six
I'm an 11, you're in heaven when I punish it
I got her naked but I know I wasn't gonna hit
She was lookin at it like that isn't gonna fit
I told her I was only gonna use half of it
If you want a smaller size go and rent a plastic dick
Why you actin like you a genital activist
Matter of fact you can get out, you can pack your shit
And she was like, "Ay, why you gotta act like this?"
Cus your wastin my time you can ask my wrist
Now you trying to talk to me about abstinance
She was like wait a second let me ask you this
Is you're name Chamillionaire, do you rap?
No
Ain't you on that song with Kanye West and Stat Quo?
Ron C says you was
Oh is that so?
And then I said if he did don't know what he told you that fo

[Intro: Kanye West and choir]
Now turn it up, turn it up, a little louder
Turn it up, turn it up, little louder
Now turn it up, can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my, I, I can't live
Now turn it up, turn it up

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Yeah, yo I can't live my I, I can't live my
Life this way, continually get high
Instead of running 'round, lock one bird down
It's a new day, gotta do it big just to get right
Show no respect can't live that way
You hold my check, can't live that way
Without my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like, but I've been that way
Our moves calculated through the lens, almost here
Success will be the best revenge
Man, from Clint East' to Kanye West
The sun can't chill but everyday it sets (Evidence!)

[Hook: Choir + (Female Choir)]
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'mma let go starting tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now, she a Christian
My White girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pulling girls off the bench like a sixth man
I'm in the club doing the same ol' two step
While Omegas doing the same ol' "Q" step
I have my money on my mind, I was thinking green
She a pledge A.K.A., she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We saying the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spitting game I was scrimmaging
My penmanship so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, getting laid or getting paid
I just know when I'm getting one, the other's getting away
This way

[Hook: Choir + (Female Choir)]
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'mma let go starting tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

[Verse 3: Rakaa Iriscience]
Go 'head, flip a coin so the game can start
Believe I know the drama, kid name the part
I learned before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came to 'Pac
But this industry'll play with your life man
They playing with your rent, food, water and lights man
That's why Rakaa brings it like that ol' Toddy Tee jam
The Batterram then I'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up for strength to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals, to deal with this hate
I dedicate this Jam Master Jay
Run-D.M.C. showed me how to walk, this way

[Hook: Choir + (Female Choir)]
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'mma let go starting tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way




[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Lets get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight

And you don't give a damn what they all say right?
Awesome
The christian in Christian Dior
Damn they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Is anybody out there anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fakeness
So go ahead go nuts go apeish
'Specially on my best stand on my bapeness
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey take six, and take this, haters

[Chorus]
N- n- now th- that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause it can't get much longer
I know I got to be right now

That's how long I've been on ya

[Bridge]
I need you right now
I need you right now

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
God put me in the plans or not
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that god put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me
There's a thousand you's there's only one of me
I'm trippin' I'm caught up in the moment right?
This is Louis Vuitton dime night
So we gon' do everything that 'J' like
Heard they'd do anything for a klondike
Well I'd do anything for a blonde-dyke
And we'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Baby you're makin' it
Harder, better, faster, stronger

[Chorus]
N- n- now th- that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
Cause I can't wait much longer

Liquor all night, love it
Untamed youths, the Coupes moves like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drank
Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wyling and all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word
We all in together, now we off it
Cops be buggin', shotguns on the whip
Fuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggy
You can catch me high, it's all good, no Biggie

[Hook: Kid Cudi]

Fee, fi, fo fum, bitches so dumb
On a balcony making out with me, like she so drunk
Got me feeling like a damn hunk
Headed home I'm bout to slam dunk
Pray to the box of mags, protect me when I'm old
Pop a few Vi-rags, resurrect me
Geezer, Ebenezer
Grab titties, prob'ly catch a fucking seizure
But keep a big ass crib with a theater
Remind me of my money when I catch amnesia, oww!

[Hook: Kid Cudi]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Rage, 'cause I'm paid

Awesome, no mo' bitches playin possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, when a women with some toes
Optimos, takin trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high, go with ya soul and try floatin through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and mimosas
Costa Rica, next on the agenda

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that through the body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea

You got the swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I may be young, but I'm ready

Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love

Just don't tell nobody tomorrow

Speakers knocking till the morning light

[Hook: Beyonce and Slick Rick]

Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close don't let me go
So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
Cause tonight's the night uh uh oh aye
That I give you everything
Music knocking till the morning light
Cause we like to party

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don’t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di… (Cause we like to party)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
Cause toni-ni-ni-ght
That I give you everything
Music knocking till the morning light

[Hook: Beyonce & Andre 3000]
Cause we like to party (Eh)
We like to party (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Cause we like to party (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

Cause we like to party (Eh, eh, eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We like to party
Cause we like to party

[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce you dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got that swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh




[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't have all the hood rats and mud rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that’s how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah feel

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Open Verse]

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post Chorus: Kanye West]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feelin' better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter: that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local, c'mon, homie, we major

[Post Chorus: Nas]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, still"
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homie we major

[Hook: Kanye West + (Nas)]
We major? (C'mon homie we major)
We major? (C'mon homie we major)
We major (C'mon homie we major)
We major

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never; it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Spoken: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals! Sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me: "Why you call it Late Registration, 'Ye?"
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Bridge: Tony Williams + Kanye West]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orientation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
We want you to get used to this
Uhh, they can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh, they can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh, they can't do what we do baby
Yeah

You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)

[Interlude: Beyoncé]
As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How’d he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin’
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin’ to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don’t rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
What it do?

[Scratches: A-Trak & Kanye West]
What it do? What–what it do?
What–what it do? What it–what it do? Wh–what it do?
Wh–what it do? What it do?
Wh–what it do? Wh–what it do?
What it–what it do? Wh–what it do?
Wh–what it do? Wh–what it do? (You never know, homie)
Wh–what it do? Wh–what it do?

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Drive slow, homie, homie, homie
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie, home, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie, homie, homie
Live today, ’cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I’m the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious (Uh-huh)
I got the custom grill (Yeah), I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, it's evident
You see a player flicking, now how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit? (Just a lil bit)
I got my custom kings, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green (Now what?)
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder's quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, so this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Chorus: Kanye West, GLC & Both]
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow

[Outro: Kanye West, GLC & Both]
What up, y'all?
That's GLC in the buildin'
It's G.O.O.D. Music, baby
We love
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
You know, you know I enjoy bein' here
And I love doin' songs from the new album, but
I gotta do a joint that, if it wasn't for this one right here
I would've never made it this far
Let's see if y'all remember this joint right here




[Intro]
A'udhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem. Bismillah-i'r Rahman-i'r Raheem

Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar

This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan and right here in America
(Jesus Walks)

Abraham Taught
Muhammad Taught
And Moses split the sea
(Jesus Walk with me)
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free

[Verse 1]
G's up along with Muhammad and Jesus
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace, but the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High, so the struggle
Continues
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes

[Hook]
Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
(Astaghfirullah)

[Verse 2]
And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
The Creator of the worlds, Sculptor of the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer, God deemed it unclean
(There's no eatin' of the swine)
Nor drinkin' of the wine
We all bend to his whims, so I send out a message to my kind
I’m cordial to Mr. Norful, Mrs. Adams you’re the theme song when I’m battling
Creflo, player, what’s happening? I can hear the truth in your rappings
(No)
Sex before you marry
No grudges
You should carry, no lyin'
Not supposed to be gamblin'

[Hook]
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)

[Verse 3]
You know
(uh)
And to my Akh's tryin to stay on their deen
It gets mean especially when you stay on the scene
And at the same try to stay out of trouble
But don't forget the blessin' is in the struggle
The Most Forgiving will forgive it if you stay repentant
And hustle
You gotta stay on your salats, your zakats, your Quran
To my homies and miskeen
Astagfirullah
Allah forgive us all
For we all are sinners
Bless us to be among the winners
When it ends
But until then please strengthen the mission within our hearts
All praise is due to God
(Amen)
Tellin' it how it was taught me
I ain't tryin' to sell it can be brought for free
This is how it is
Now how it ought to be
Muhammad talk to me
Jesus walk with me
I hope

[Hook]
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)




[Intro]
While you're fast asleep

[Verse 1]
Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?

[Chorus]
I feel like this
I feel like this
I feel like that
I feel like this all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

[Verse 2]
Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?

[Chorus]
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

[Verse 3]
Do you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling in parts of your body, trouble catchin' your breath?

[Chorus]
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time




[Produced by Kanye West, No I.D., and Jeff Bhasker]

[Verse 1]
On lonely nights, I start to fade
On lonely nights, I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away
Her love's a thousand miles away

[Chorus]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter

[Verse 2]
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see
Her love is all that I can see

[Chorus]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?

[Verse 3]
If spring can take the snow away
If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all our mistakes
Can it melt away all our mistakes

[Chorus 2]
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again




Hotter than a... Let's go get em!

[Hook]
I want my cash stacked real high
Mu and Yak we still fly
Lift my drink up to the sky
Cause that's where I wanna be tonight

[Yak Ballzl]
In the day I'm outta sight
But I'm always around at night
Till the freaks come out at night
Like Michael Jackson Thriller right
Ya doing it, kill it, pop the trunk and put two in it
Feel it, I don't give up, I'm doing it
Picking Mu up in the tank, come thru in it
And start shootin shit
And all the bitches wanna know who I'm wit
Cause I got chicks like [?] Trina and Ludacris
(Weathermen Motherfuckers!)
So I tell em come one come all
To the crib for the players ball
And all you gotta do is call
1-800-DROP-THEM-DRAWERS
We can get intimate, Doing push-ups on you all militant
Bitch I don't give a shit
I might love you tonight but I'm still a pimp
You love the way that I hold it down
Like I'm rich with a chain all frozen now
You know the kid Yak Biz like a 40 Cal
When he spittin, all the thugs and the hoes like wowww
Yo kid is nice. They wanna know what he's really like
Shorty trying to find out if I'm her type
I gotta man but I need him in my life
Ya you fucking right, Yak Ballz is nothing nice
Come fly in like a kite
And that's cool, that's where I wanna be tonight

[Hook]
I want my cash stacked real high
Mu and Yak we still fly
Lift my drink up to the sky
Cause that's where I wanna be tonight

[Camu Tao]
Everybody lined up at the bar
After 12 shots of Cuervo I crashed my car
Don't you see me bleeding, cop put the gun away
Cause I put my injured ass back in the club
12 model mommys at the door looking for love
Too bloody for the bouncer now he's looking for gloves
I can be honest I know this noise scary
Put out a lot of bloody money ordered a Bloody Mary
And if it's too off the wall, and ya sick [?]
Get a knife, scrape it off ya brain
And if it's off the hook, and the lines out the door
And I'm here then it's off the chain
6 model mommy's starting stuff, shaking they stuff
Homo thugs outside fighting looking for slugs
Look they making up now they looking for love
Let me see them tits before I have to throw up
Cause shit cuz, Ima fall at the same strip club
Cause I came here expecting a dick rub
Drinks full of drip blood, needle stuck in my dick
Plus niggas in the back smacking they bitch up

[Hook]
I want my cash stacked real high
Mu and Yak we still fly
Lift my drink up to the sky
Cause that's where I wanna be tonight

Yall niggas hold grudges but what we hold never budges
Everybody in one fight like busta douglas

Niggas could a have a payment on that onions
These onions get chopped up cooked and rocked up
Yea i give that time rapper before you see my ass get locked up
Too late the cops popped up, popped us, hella copped us with doctors chiropractors
It’s a dope deal documentary follow me into the penitentiary
Where they hid niggas fo centuries
Hoppin out the century because they sent for me
I put in more legwork than a centipede
I make your leg don’t work if you mention me
I put the ak to work for a fri-enemy
Before a enemy i died his hair with the infrared and give him a fatal injury
Yo

[Chorus:]
So if you coming to this side amma hook you up
And as soon as you get to queens boss look me
And if you ever in the hunter's dog look me up
And when you down on your luck yo that jooks is up
Consequence if you rolling in this side let me hook you up
When you in nyc baby look me up
And if you eva in atlanta dog look me up
And when down on your luck yo that jooks is up

[Verse 2:]
Ayo rhymefest, the consta two headed monsta
Now pierce and walker yo bitch’s a stalka
Suckin me off while ya kid was in the walka

Drop and give me 10 drop and give me cast
Prob in jimmy’s car time squares a hassle
Got Glock up to ya ass

Nigga be try’na run but bullets is really fast
You trippin like white girls in horror flicks
I’m the black jason with jordan kicks
Chasing you through the forest
On my block  if there ain't rhymes or courses
Mos and mo folks dying everyday in the orphanage
Gila d and torches lbs the organs
Need the money fast to i took keys to oregon
Got em all cooked so i came back with more a dem
Cause i’m balded headed the same way a tortoise is
You don’t get it as fast as ma nigga said it
Yall niggas ain't poetic yall nigga is pothetic
Don’t sweat it go gettas go get it don’t miss it
When you coming to the shop bring ya strap every visit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Yo fats as soon as you hit the hood we going straight to the l
That’s where you get  fly spend all yo cash

Lets drive down lake shore drive the navy appeal
But it ain't like the past days where ya stroll to time square
Hood straighten up ya habit niggas crazy here
They got a place in queens but we do the same thangs
It’s called 1i2 where the bulldogs bangin
We can eat on herold’s dinner on 87th and jefferies
Cruise to hyde park where them girls is sexy
It’s so high class nigga don’t ask
Just tell em you from new york they’ll give you some ass (word)
A week ago to jimbos with them same bimbos
Throw em all the passes the tournament of nymphos
Give the homie yellow diamonds red tape
And 3 air ones the only way they’ll escape

[Chorus]




[Intro: Kanye West]
Um, I'd like to introduce myself
Coming to a theater near you this summer or, really, like right now
Oh
It's Kanye, to the
I used to live in the movies, you know
So uh, get your popcorn, get your condiments
Turn your cellphones off, you don't wanna miss nothing

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had to stab big nigga, tryna sell me a lick
He said "Analyze this, this as good as it gets"
Now don't be bedazzled by the purple haze
It ain't gon be the color of *Purple Rain*
I told him
Just break it off, light it up, set it off man
How hot? Better make Eddie cough, man
And them shrooms'll have a man on the moon
Cookin up flow in the boiler room
I want DMX style of run, exit wound
I want the X-Men around me, Malcolm X could use
Like no one man should have all that power
Get all that powder in 48 hours
And he stick the kingpin. or king of New York
They probably just queens of comedy
If you in my things, you *Suicide Kings*
There's only *Three Kings*, *Me, Myself and Irene*

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They call me *Edward Scissorhands* cause I'm trying to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gon' get you to suck
And you not gon' use your teeth, you hear?
You gon' find out *What Lies Beneath* right here
*The Preacher's Wife* don't give head, get a divorce, man
*The Kids* been calling you the headless horseman
Like *Sleepy Hollow*, see she swallow
Suck like ol' girl, got booed at *Apollo 13*, *Ghosts*
Use my *Hollow Man* for *Friday 13th*
You be *Ghost*, *Backdraft* from the toast
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, now they *Almost Famous*
My bling got 'em calling me *Lord of the Rings*
*The Shining* make it hard for her to *Do The Right Thing*
But *I Don't Say a Word*, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I know *Something About Mary* (mm-hmm)
*I Know What You Did Last Summer* before Sally met Harry
Back when I was sprung on *Carrie*
Must've been on some *Shallow Hal*
Cause she was definitely wasn't no Halle Barry
I guess I did it for the *Glory*
Now the players love that *Neverending Story*
My Christian story, shorty
Talked about my outfit, but they quit
Cause I'll shoot your eye out, kid
Don't forget
My school days back in *Cooley High*
I wasn't trippin, just foolish, just crusin by
Yo Gerard, Dr. Nichols in the hospital
Yo, I was out to prove that it was possible
And why your *Bodyguard* come home like Kevin Costner do
I love men who can pimp her, like a prostitute
I tell her this relationship is like the 1st rule of *Fight Club*-
Don't talk about *Fight Club*

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I'm livin' the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
I'm livin the movies, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose your cool
Sit back and enjoy the show

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

[Chorus: Kanye West & The Game]
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)
That's that crack music nigga

That's that crack music nigga

That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
(La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah)

[Outro: Malik Yusef]
Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music

[John Legend]
If I could, I'd give you the world
Wrap it all around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of this heart
My angel, oh angel
You're my angel, oh angel

[Stacy Barthe]
Oh, dreams are dreams
Some dreams come true
I found a real dream, baby when I found you
You're so strong but tender too
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel




I am not here right now; I am not home
Leave a message after the life. Flat line tone
I am not here right now; I am not home
Leave a message after the life; after I'm gone




[Intro: Mike Shinoda & Jay-Z]
Yeah
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind! (Whoo!)
Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Get 'em Jay!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
Encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar




[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Kanye, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
She gotta drink water 'cause she thirsty
She danced like 92 hundred songs back to back
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel... you know what she told me?
(Are you gonna be?) Check it out, this is what she said
(Say that you're gonna be) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Luther]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Interlude: Kanye West]

You know what I told her?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo pants off

[Interlude: Aisha Tyler & Kanye West]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please? Do it faster, baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast... but I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan Man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (Well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I love the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit' me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit' me, Chi ride

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Luther]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Bridge 2: Jamie Foxx & Tracie Spencer]

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Luther]

She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right

[Hook]
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
Ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't (Flint let's go)
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse]
I ain't finna sit around and let the shit ride now, wait until it all dies down
While my people being murdered, what they doing here in Flint is genocide now
We can't turn a blind eye now, and keep quiet while they kill niggas
Someone gotta pay, they might have to the governor inside the Flint River
Corporate lies, leaked emails; treating niggas like we retail
Put your life up for a price, where the keep spinning like Sprewells
Try'na breath but we suffocating, lead water that's intoxicating
Don't tell me it's coincidental, they want black people depopulated
City 60 percent black, rest of them all white
If it was the other way around, they wouldn't let it ride for a single night
No questions, no questions please
Get you on your knees like Eric Garner screaming 'I can't breathe'
The police kill you for a cigarette, I guess it's worth more than a life
So we blacking out on Oscar night because you know the Oscars is so white
Don't ask me why I'm mad, bitch I'm enraged
Who? Me? They should know my name

[Hook]
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
Ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't (Flint let's go)
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

I came out that swamp, can't ignore it (yeah)
Now all my pockets is on Norbit

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
They mad 'cause we grinded up from the top
I was on the block, no guap, runnin' from cops
They talk about me, they wanted to see the album flop
And we will never stop, the game on Buscemi lock
I do wrong and do right, forgive me for not livin' right
Sippin' on Bud, like givin' you advice I'm actin' white
Mansion on acres, my white friends I only invite

Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

[Brigde: Eminem]
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the f*ck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherf*cker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

[Bridge: Eminem]
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

[Bridge: Linkin Park]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...)

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar




I ride for this shit, and I'll die for this shit
And I'll ride for this shit, and I'll die...

I don't want to be like what everyone else be like
If that means I gotta be like what everyone else be like then I don't want to be liked
If I gotta be like, what everybody else be like
Then I don't want to be liked
I don't want to be liked
Because I was so...
Dig down in your soul
And look to the sky above
Being liked is nothing, when you could be loved
God is love
God is love
God is love
God is love
So I would rather follow God than to follow the media
I would rather follow God than to follow perception
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more and more I'm disliked, the better I must be doing
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more I'm disliked, the much, the better I must be doing
You know why? Because I don't want to be liked
If that means, I gotta be like the way everyone else be like
The way everyone else sees like
The way everyone else does...
I've got my own vision and make my own decisions
And don't ask for permission, and I am on a mission
I am on a mission
I only want to do it on my conditions
I only want to do it my way
I'm only going to do it His way
I'm only going to do it this way
I'm only going to do it this way
I'm only going to do it this way
If you love someone tonight
Hold on to it
If you love someone tonight
Hold on, hold on real tight
Hold on, hold on real tight

Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, always find, yeah, always find, yeah, always find something...
So you've been puttin' with this just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us, to have a...
Let's have a toast for the...
Ayy, let's have a toast for the...
Ayy, let's have a toast for the...
Hey, everyone in there that I...
Ayy, let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take...
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It's what ya all been waitin' fo', ain't it?
What people pay paper fo', damn it
They can't stand it, they want somethin' new
So let's get reacquainted, became the hood favorite
I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Refrain: Kanye West]
We outta here, baby! We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Dude! Fresh off the plane – Konnichiwa, bitches!
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it, I did it – that asshole done did it!
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writ–ears, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year?
They say "He goin' crazy and we seen this befo'"
But I'm doin' pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doin' pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga, please, how you gon' say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head?
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard till your knees hit yo' forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top five MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top five MCs, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big, you can't sit behind me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, we outta here, baby!
What? What? We outta here, baby!
Ayy, Mr. West, we so outta here, baby!
And me? I'm Mr. Weezy Baby, yeah!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm so bright, not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fuckin' good like I'm sleepin' with Meagan (ha!)
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns, and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them" – I'm so crazy!
But if you play crazy, you be sleepin' with daisies
I'm such a hayvoc – oops, I meant "havoc"!
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still col' like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties (baow!)
And I ate it 'cause I'm so avid (no homo)
And I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried – suck my bat, bitch (ha!)

[Refrain: Kanye West & Lil Wayne]
We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!
We outta here, baby!
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit' that fresh shit on
Wit' somethin' crazy on my arm, uh-huh-hum
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds




[Intro: Keri Hilson]
I can do the pretty girl rock, rock
Rock to the pretty girl rock, rock, rock

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière
You can stare, but if you touch it, I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I ain't gotta talk about it, baby you can see it
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it

[Verse 2: Keri Hilson]
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière
You can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury
Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
For the nigga, they love to hate
But all the bad model girls, they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check, check my swag and get up to date
Cause when we cut, I'm razor blading
I'm so lazer, I'm so major
I'm so Flava, I'm so Flava
Baby, I should have a clock on
While ya get ya, get ya, get ya pretty girl rock on
For all my girls from Atlanta out to Stockholm
And they looking like "what the hell you got on?"
"What you mean, babygirl? I got homes!"
Different cribs, new whips
And I'm feelin fly, fly like a G6
Fly, my swag hit on ladies unknowingly
Pleased to meet ya, its a pleasure knowing me
Back when I was poor I used to pull em with my poetry
Tick that yes or no for me, I guarantee she go with me
But the only thing I need to know right now's
What a pretty girl like you doing in this part of town
With a city girl swag and a country girl smile
I mean, you demoralizing bitches with your style
Wow, well how about now?
My jewelry so loud, my girls so wow
I mean, I mean swag so loud
I guess thats the reason all the concerts sell out

[Post-Chorus: Keri Hilson & Kanye West]
Aye, now do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock
Now where you at?

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
If you're looking for me you can catch me (hot spot)
Cameras flashing, daddy's turned his head as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him?
Get yourself together don't hate (never do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk my talk the way I dress
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful




[Verse 1]
Lo- Lord, the air is foul with the smell of hypocrisy
As bloody armies scream- screams for victory
Lying there in the mire is a mama and child
Their anguished cries trampled by boots on either side

[Verse 2]
Now with bloodshot eyes we look out beyond earth's gate
Seeking new planets to plant seeds of hate, yeah
Progress, it's said, makes for a softer bed, mmm
But no one will lie easy if everyone lies dead
Now it's time, I think, and I think you'll agree, oh
To love thy neighbor and set all men free
So take the shackles from the wings of the dying dove
And permit her to fly away to peace and love, yeah




I'm just a wolf inside a lion's suit
A shark shirt, a panther's pants, piranha hat and tiger shoes
I got a lion's den inside the booth
That right there is point blank
This here is from where the sniper shoot
Might take a long time to get it, by the time I hit it
I done ran Bubble Tape around them Chiclets, poof
I ain't the bomb, I'm the company that got the contract
To rebuild during the aftermath - have a blast
Going green only using half the gas
The calming comes through after disasters have
But this calm has the same fury that disasters have
I should have a class, I'm the son/sun of the South Pole plus Alaska's dad
Got niggas like "DAG!!", flow is like crazy gone mad
And villains gone bad, Punk ass niggas, don't be so Daft
Baby, why you hanging with them Busters like Babs?
They are such a drag, you should move them to the trash
Feel like I'm walking round upon Cassius calves
Quite a beautiful script, and such a gift of gab
A big Bay shout out to Mistah F.A.B
Young Frankenstein reporting live from the lab
I bought the bars out, put it on my tab
If you came here to box, you'll leave in a bag
I run the game, Bilderberg Group, in the lead with the flash
Usain Bolt ain't even leaving this fast
Why you take offense with your defensive ass?
Never Hussein in the (w)hole, not even in the half
Cause nigga I ain't hiding, I'm the whole world, nigga you're an island
And the seas rising, if I keep shining
You going have to take submarines to the drive-in now




[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Man I promise, when I get old enough
I'mma buy you a limo, and we gon' go to Red Lobster
And you can get all the.. all the lobster tail that you want
Cause I'ma be rich! Yeah I'ma be rich, uhh...

[Hook]
When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em

Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, Cons don't forget 'em

[Verse 1]
I finally got my first real money
So should I turn Hollywood? I probably could
And turn my back on the hood
And never go back, but I ain't with that
See this is where I learned to rap
And this is where I learned to scrap
And this is how I learned to stack
Penny by penny and bit by bit
Watchin the older heads move brick by brick
And one hand would wash the other
And one aunt would watch your brother
And your father wound up watchin your mother
And the prettiest smile you ever discovered
Becomes when you call her face
And your second cousin lost his case
They gave him 25-to-life, what a waste
And they tryin to pay your lawyer, but they just ignore ya
So he ended up goin upstate, uhh

[Hook]
When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
When you make that money boy

When you make that money boy
They say don't you forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, don't don't forget 'em
Don't forget 'em, Cons don't forget 'em

[Verse 2]
I finally got my first real money so of course they all
Up in my grill cause they need help with the bills
And I'm like "Homey just chill
I got you my nig, just let me get big"
And I promise I'll be back, cause I need the feedback
And the honesty every time that you react
Cause nothin can buy that, nothin provides that
'Cept when you drive back
And cruise through the blocks of the hood you're from
To holla at your folks, that's the rule of thumb
Cause y'all came up together, y'all was crew from young
But some of them went on to abuse them drugs
Confusin love, for they addiction
Now they out there on a mission
And lost sight of the do's and don'ts
But I'll be wrong if I forgot so I won't

[Hook]
When you make that money boy

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 1]
I spent my last eight checks-s-s on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shit
She wanna sip up on the Crissy Cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister in that white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie, they only fives but together they ten
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm
It's like old folks pissin' 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin', this track got you movin'
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head 'til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fore I pay for this room 'cause

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 2]
Now if you got it, you got it
And if you don't then you probably won't
Sissy nigga call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
Buy 'em boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know




[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said "He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario"

[Hook]




[Hook: Chief Keef]
Mando, bitch, gettin' money mando
Mando, nigga, shootin' up your bando
Mando, bitch, I need my money pronto
Like Broncos
Bitch, we blitzin' shit like Broncos
Bitch it's mandatory, I'm in my glory
End of story with a 40
She like "Why you gettin' it?"
I'm like "Bitch that's mandatory"
Crib big, that's mandatory
I'm mansion tourin' with my shorties
Mando, I'm with my brodies
Mando, I get my money




[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
"Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?"
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Chuch, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire, I got stripes: Adidas
Mamis scream "¡Papi, no más!"
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 4: T.I.]
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us




[Intro: Shane Told]
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you
Look at you

[Chorus: Shane Told]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

[Verse 1: Shane Told]
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Chorus: Shane Told]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

[Bridge: Shane Told]
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby, run away
Doesn't have to get crazy, why can't she just run away
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

[Verse 2: Cam Hunter of Down With Webster]
Okay '24/7, 365 groupies stay on their grind
I, I, I get it, alright I’ll help you get it
But now that you’re here either leave or get with it
I’m not a chauvinist, this is just reality
You can’t afford guilt on a rock band salary
Mickey full of vodka, you’re looking like Mallory
Fuck counting money, you should stick to counting calories
Let me tell you this thing here is wearin' thin
Unless you’ve got a couple friends that want sharing in
Yesterday you were outside staring in
And now you’re here and next week you’ll be here for them
Every tour bus visit every laminate
Comes with expectations from that band you’re with
This is everyday business, so manage it
Or runaway now if your ass can’t handle it

[Verse 3: Shane Told]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Plus the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of an advantage
Because you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'm a manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus: Shane Told]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things they seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And people gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' on cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, bring the drums in now, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
Uh, and I heard 'em say
With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe (What?)
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Outro: John Legend & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, and I heard 'em say
Yeah, A-Trak
John Legend, ladies and gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
I heard 'em say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
I heard them say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Nothing's ever promised, no, no
Yeah, Tracey, I know how much you like John
I told y'all I'd bring you a surprise
Thank you!




[Intro]
It was all a dream

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racin through my head
Felt so real to me, this is what was said

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
"Had a dream," I said; "Bout who?" he said
"'Bout B.I.G.," I said; "That's big," he said
"Dig what he said"; "Proceed," he said
"Indeed," I said, so, breathe I did
"Don't repeat what I say," I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
"It came to me like a whisper last evening," I said
"What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
"Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'" better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for, you might receive it," he said
"I see," I said, "jealousy" I said
"Got the whole industry mad at me," I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self"
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before"
"Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, "duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade)
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

[Outro: Jay-Z (spoken)]
"I see," I said, "jealousy" I said
"Got the whole industry mad at me," I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self"
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before"
"Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"




Yo Ferris, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
I spit it through the wire, man
If this ain't dedication I don't know what is, man
Listen, first of all I want to thank you for your support
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

Uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter
Sunsets feel righter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this
I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you notice but them accident pictures were bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cuz that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
Man, I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I go on Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throw in some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident they tellin' me it's the cheeks
And if you look at history
That last rapper that almost died sold 6.5
'Cept I'm comin' from the Chi
Through the wire to the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them could of been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Heck naw, that boy is raw

You hear that? That's all that jewelry I got on man
Sometimes I take it off at the airport but I still get stopped
They be like "There go Kayne, there go Kayne!
Can I see some I.D. please? So thank you very much"
First of all, my momma named me Kanye so y'all gon' call me Kanye
I'm like the girl on the 'Sixth Sense'
"I'm feelin' much better now"
I feel a whole hell of a lot better man




[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Yeah
Time for us to the reach for the stars
Talk Bono

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What begun as a scene is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 1: Swizz Beatz]
Woke up in the mornin' from this dream that I had
They said it was no more bombs on Baghdad
I even heard there was peace out in Egypt
Everybody in the streets representin' they freedom
I heard the recession was over now (Yes)
Peace signs in the air, bring back the soldiers now
I even seen a stone-fiend turn sober now
Things are gettin' better now, damn, how the world's goes around

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What begun as a scene is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 2: Swizz Beatz]
Woke up in the mornin' from this dream that I had
They said poverty in the world wasn't comin' back
I even heard the doctor killed cancer in the lab
The education system made a big comeback
Damn, it was all 'bout a week ago
We pray to the most high to let our dreams flow
We pray to the most high to let our dreams grow
You got dreams of skyscrapers, let the world know, oh

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What begun as a scene is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
My hands straight to the sky, I can't escape this high
Sometimes I felt like I just couldn't wait to die
If I fall, I can't fly, can't hate the sky
For not slowin' me down before I hit the ground
Before I hit the town, I used to hit the weed
Try to hang around thieves just tryna get degrees
But I end up 'round rats just tryna get the cheese
It ain't gotta be all that, I ain't beggin', but, bitch, please

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What begun as a scene is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Outro: Bono]
Put your hands up and touch the sky
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers
Put your hands high and touch the sky
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers
Breezes in the summer comin' sky
In jungles through the life of flashin' lights
Feel for the, feel for
For




[Intro: Nayt]
Non si ferma per me
Se la prendo mi da
Tutto ciò che serve alla fine
Con queste rime ci morirò
Questa vita qua
Non va, non va
Yeah, yeah yo, yo
Per sempre o mai

[Strofa 1: Nayt]
Sto allo stato brado, bro
L'arresto è passato, vado, yo
La gente è pacifica, peace
Altra invece mi critica, diss
Gli hater sul palco gridano: "Kiss"
E ne ho visto, restringo la scena come i jeans
Nayt: a beast
Quando rappo mi chiedono: "Nayt, fai bis?"
Yeah, mi prendi il mic
Scordi che sarà il mio identikit
Se sai o non sai non cambia: non impari
Ascoltano più di prima, non senti i click
Vita troia: bitch
Rubo quel che posso da gran ladro: thief
Nayt ti diventa la nuova bomba: neo king
Ho appena iniziato, ammazzati, rest in, in peace

[Ritornello: Nayt]
Questa corsa che va
Non si ferma per me
Se la prendo mi da
Tutto ciò che serve alla fine
Con queste rime ci morirò
Questa vita qua
Non va, non va
O è per sempre o è mai
Questa vita qua
Non va, non va
O è per sempre o è mai

[Strofa 2: MadMan]
Questa vita è un business
Più la fotto più ci vado sotto: mistress
Mi stresso ma sul beat T-Rex
Toglimi tutto, non la mia sickness!
Vedo rosso il ribes
Metti a posto i Lines
Passami quei Kleenex
Fitta inguinale, ti sto per inquinare
Non farti pare, l'amore è sanguinare
Ogni rima una batosta
Adesso tu dammi la grana, fra' la fama costa
Accumulo i miei testi depressi dentro una borsa
L'accoltello sul palco e ne estraggo la lama rossa!
Spedivo magliette dalla posta
Dalla parte opposta di chi può fare la rockstar
Ora Nayt la fa grossa
Hall of Fame, All Stars

[Ritornello: Nayt]
Questa corsa che va
Non si ferma per me
Se la prendo mi da
Tutto ciò che serve alla fine
Con queste rime ci morirò
Questa vita qua
Non va, non va
O è per sempre o è mai




[Hook: Jennifer Lawrence]
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes, well sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
It's for yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porscha" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Because-
Because-
Because-
Because-
I Am A God
I Am A God

[Hook: Jennifer Lawrence]
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree

[Break: Kanye West]
Just like that
When someone comes up and says something like "I am a god"
Everybody says "Who does he think he is?"
I just told you who I thought I was, a god!
I just told you!
That's who I think I am!
Would it have been better if I had a song that said, "I am a nigga"?

[Refrain: Kanye West]

[Hook: Jennifer Lawrence]
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree




[Intro: The-Dream]
Hello? Hello? Hello...
Is there anybody up here?
Hello?
Welcome...2085. Twenty eighty-five it is
Just me up here I guess

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
The magic of the moment snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise
Roamin' and I'm lonely
But I'm only
There's somethin in your eyes
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin' on to me

[Hook]
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Don't keep me waitin', I'm impatient
C'mon to my runway, lets take off and fly
Now I'm where I wanna be
Come co-pilot with me
Lets burn up the sky

And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin on to me


[Hook]
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Everyone out there will know that you are my girl
And my love will circle around and round
No matter what I do

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Aye aye Dream I'm too good at this
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I can't contain it
No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it?
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you
Put your Blackberry down
People is around you
I'll put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you
And Uhmm, maybe white gown you
And Uhmm, maybe we should talk about all this after I pound you
Ha, you know I'm just playin' with you
I know a lot of people mad cause they ain't with you
Wait is it because we on the moon
Tell 'em to save the hate we'll be home soon

[The-Dream]
There's something you do
That got me walkin on the moon
Uhh, and I know that its true
Baby, you got me walkin on the moon
Everyone out there will know that you are my girl

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Blueprint, trois
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
What we talkin' about? Real shit, or we talkin' about rhymes?
You talkin' about millions, or you talkin' about mine?
What we talkin' about? 'Cause I ain't got time
For what people be talkin' about all the time
What we talkin' about? Fiction, or we talkin' about fact?
You talkin' about fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talkin' about life, and all I hear is
"Oh yeah, he keeps talkin' about crack."
I ain't talkin' about profit, I'm talkin' about pain
I'm talkin' about despair, I'm talkin' about shame
I ain't talkin' about gossip, I ain't talkin' about Game
I ain't talkin' about Jimmy, I ain't talkin' about Dame
I'm talkin' about real shit, them people playin'
What is you talkin' about? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talkin' about "Hov, take it back!"
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothin' cool 'bout carryin' a strap
About worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
Talkin' about revenge while carryin' his casket
All teary-eyed, about to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' about music, I ain't talkin' about rap
You talkin' about who's hot, I ain't talkin' about that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map

[Chorus: Luke Steele & (Jay-Z)]
They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
(I see what y'all talkin' about, ha ha)
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Still they can't focus on them, they be talkin' about me
Talkin' about what I wear, talkin' about where I be
Check out my hair: these ain't curls, these is peas
"Peasey head" still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' about progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track; try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' about "Hov left 'em flat."
Try to rewrite history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more, but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard, now get off my sack—scream at me!

[Chorus: Luke Steele & (Jay-Z)]
They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?
(Blueprint 3)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer
Posin' with guns, shootin' YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House, get your suit up!
You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up
Peace out Medusa
Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah
Tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Tooter of my own horn, beep beep, moo-ya
Rass clot when rude boy come through with the roof up
So I could see the sky
'Cause everybody talkin' Hov, I think we know why

[Chorus: Luke Steele]
They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?




[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (This shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)

[Verse 2: Pusha-T]
They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Santería!

[Refrain: Kanye West]
After long, afternoons good go
Sacred stories of home, they go
It's the code of Mamman Shata
Something only we know
That's the code named, Mamman Shata
Something only we know

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
After all of the news good go
Sacred stories of home, they go
It's the code of [?]
Something only we know
That's the code named, [?]
Something only we know

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santería!

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
After all of the news good go
Sacred stories of home, they go
It's the code of [?]
Something only we know
That's the code named, [?]
Something only we know




[Verse 1]
Number one, so together I'm eleven
She's a ten, I'm number one, together we eleven
Her friend only a seven, sent her to 7-Eleven
She a ten, she a seven, that make 'em seventeen
Let me see your ID, only seventeen?
Eesh, that could have fucked up everythin'
Nike, already don't like me, always on a white tee
Dressed like I'm hypebeast, signed through my white tee
Dont race against the American dream
Together we like the Kenyan marathon team
Three black rap acts that spit that crack
Never pushed that 'Lac, rather push somethin' German
Lookin' for a Swedish bitch that I could put my sperm in
Preach, my brother, gon' start the sermon
All I see is green, call me Erick Sermon
All I spit is thermal, long-sleeved flannel
When I touch the verse, don't touch the channel
Bought the rat a purse, she keep callin' it Chanel
Never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit annual
Now that's some dumb shit
I never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit, dumb bitch
And I mean that in a nicer sense to the word
Just act like I'm some type of nice sensitive nerd
I don't fiend female dogs
Cause I done dogged all females
Except for the ones that's only in it for the retail
She see what you got, she see what we sell
Get married so much, I swear them girls on resell
She watchin' the draft, she got your jersey already
She 'bout to pick out her crib in Jersey already
She 'bout to be pregnant by Thursday already
Congratulations, baby boy, on your new baby boy

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't; the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful—blasted-boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children; zip it; listen

[Chorus: Justin Vernon, Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somebody told me Delta's brown-skinned, AKA's light-skinned
And they supposed to be bougie, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'ma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hype man"
Last year a nigga hit her, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightenin', but

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth like I'm comin' out the mouths of babes
One foot in and one foot out the grave, niggas want they reparations, how you calculate the amount to be paid?
You try to imagine America without the slaves (The slaves)

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Good looks, Ye! Her tenement, yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion because she went and protested
'Cause her best friend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a Glock
In the hood is an everyday happenin'
In front of the precinct, she chews out the captain
She yells out, "Why y'all do this to black men?" C'mon

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 4: Common]
I think of eighty-seven ways to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
The music, ridin' it good like Escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Lil Wayne and Tha Carters's that-

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it

[Verse 5: Rhymefest]
C'mon, look
Tell people the truth, but never give 'em your true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnnie Cochran dead, who gonna get us "Us free" now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs in the penal?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, dawg, I see now

[Chorus: Kanye West (Tony Williams)]
We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better (better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it




[Intro: Talib talking]:
Talib Kweli. Kanye West. "Pay close attention to my story" John Legend. "You'll find every word is true" Blacksmith, G.O.O.D. Music connection. It get's no better than this. Exclusives. One, two. Mic check. Mic check

[Hook]
"Young man standing on the corner"
Young man where you goin' in life, you know it ain't right
"Sellin' death, no conscious has he"
You can't escape the shadow in the light
Shine on ya
"Young man standing on the corner"
Young man where you goin' in life, you know it ain't right
"Sellin' death, no conscious has he"

[Verse One]
Yeah, the conscious MC
Sometimes I keep it simple
Fuck what the nerds say
Ain't tryin' to impress you with the intricate wordplay
Catch me at a bodega and plus I know my neighbors
A little too well, it's like my walls are made of paper
But this is New York City
Where our music Biggie
We do it gritty, take you through it like you grew up with me
First I'mma make a comment
It's time to change the context of what's considered conscious
We the concept obnoxious
And let me make a promise
I'mma always keep it honest
And to portray all my people cause we put in boxes
Category
Tryin' to make a break through
Dealin' with the hateful
Tryin' to stay faithful
Got an attitude house niggas can't relate to
Listening to music that the field niggas escape to
I plays phonetic
Over revolutionary rhetoric
Cause I'm down for action like a predicate

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
You can't escape
You can't escape
He patriotic to his niggas over God and country
He felt 'Pac when he said Only God Can Judge Me
You see the [?] walkin' in the playground
Stalkin' like a predator, you're baby ain't safe now
Wait now, ain't it big how he talkin' like he evil
And the [?] never acknowledge how he could be tryin' to feed his people
Young, black and throw in a line up
Labeled as a 'gang banger' though he never signed up
Cops is tryin' to get the crime up
You get that on your record
Employers gonna check it
Fire you, so now you gotta resort to the only method
The scene will guarantee any sense of clarity
As to when the rental be paid, it's street salary
You're sure to meet tragedy, die or go to jail
But somehow, it all seems worth it and that's real
Wishin' for the day you can say it's your last deal
But you know you be portrayed like Jesus at His last meal
That's...

[Hook]




[Chorus]
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

[Verse 1]
I' told you from childhood nigga I will always be wit ya
Through hell or hot water it'll be me and you nigga
This can go down in the test of time
Whether Ripley believe it or not, make it happen once in a lifetime
Kinda hard to find, two niggas that growed up on two different sides of town
That get down like I get down, and done his like I done mine
Hit it off first time around, been solid as the foundation under the house
This some, shit for us to brag about (bout it bout it)
We answered the question and never had to take the time to think out
That's why I'll ride for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Die for my nigga
Hold ya one hand in the sky for ya nigga
Tell them you gone always remember

[Chorus]
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

[Verse 2]
You know you one of the reasons I'm still breathin cause without you I don't know where in the hell I would be
(homeboy)
You know life's been hard at home (homeboy)
That's what made us turn to the streets (homeboy)
I think that's what had us claimin thugs, sellin drugs
Duckin from the fuckin police, indulgin in
Booze and women, foolish niggas
Young, dumb, and off the leash
Outta control, but I wouldn't change it
If I could I would do it the same (if I can do it)
But if it wasn't for the game, teachin us game
We prolly would be stuck with the lames (but DAWG)
Somehow we made it, and I'm glad that I can tell ya today
That my nigga gone always be my nigga
Cuz that's the way it's ‘pose to be

[Chorus]
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wanna play some ball, Sometimes I wanna walk through the mall
(Sometimes I Wanna play some ball, and just walk through the mall)
Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone
(Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just wanna spend some time alone wit my niggas)
Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and drive till tomorrow
(Sometimes I wanna hop in the car, and just drive till tomorrow)
Sometimes I wanna pick the phone, just to see what's goin on
(Sometimes I gotta pick up the phone, just to see what's goin on wit my niggas)

[Chorus]
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave you alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know




[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
We arose, let's go
So Fresh, So Clean like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' 'bout hoes and dough again
Yup! Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' then, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I bought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rear view
V-12 engine, corners spinnin'
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first serve basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin' tags

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin' like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes, I remember havin' rocks in the hall
On the corner with the Glock by the balls
Servin' up a jab and workin' security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Buy what's on the wall, go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
To the lot and lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink, Rocawear and some guns, Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans
Dro packs and Bo Jacks and Air Maxes; throwbacks and 1s
No max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin' up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin' big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Uh-huh, whattup? Tell you somethin 'bout me
My throwback game is whiffle wicked
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin New Era fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin', keepin' coke in the kitchen
Keep a Glock that will shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Mitchell & Ness
(HA!) Scramblin', handlin' with a .45 cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan, oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirtin'
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fuckin', a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speak easy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin hot through your motherfuckin' Iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that, talk 'til the paper fat
I rock somethin', roll chief Sacks like Daddy Fat!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Pop tags in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you layin' on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox expectin a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD, that means Movie Date
Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please
My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FAO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin'
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a lil bit, dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit, dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin', a miracle happenin'
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and smabbin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Intro: Common]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Common]
I open my eyes, the corner's like African tribes
The blackest of thighs, a blackened surprise where passion arise
The youth fantasize of grass and cash in they eyes
A youth dies, and momma's asking rationalize
Trying to build a spot where ghetto bastards can rise
The ghetto's been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where blacks are despised
To act you lie scriptures, the rich are getting richer
The young are becoming thicker, summers becoming winter
Hard times, hard liquor link cards and God figures
It's moments that completes us to piece us with scar niggas
The corners I picture in motion it stars niggas
Emotions of those that be smoking like Todd Bridges
These are our bridges, from nothing to something
That's why on every city block, you hear them pumping
The corner

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh, uh-uh uh
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

[Verse 2: Scarface]
On the corner, birth place of various dreams
The ending of the beginning, the scariest thing
As we survive here to die here, whatever we seen
We accept it, live with it, or better the scheme
On the corner, the backdrop for hustling crack rock
The spot where the mac stops to issue the pack's out
There's money on the corner you'd be stupid to pass up
Remember there's a code and if it's broken we blast ya
There's Crips on the corner, Bloods on the corner
GDs and vice lords so there's thugs on the corner
There's children having fun so there's love on the corner
OGs with triple beams holding drugs on the corner
There's cops on the corner
Dope fiends that walk around in they socks is on the corner
But I love 'em, so I'm on 'em
It's life on the corner, death on the corner
We fight until our very last breath on the corner
Corner

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh, uh-uh uh
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
(The corner man!) C-O-R-N-E-R
My nigga, it's the corner, every city block got 4 of em'
It's simple math, something jumping off on all them (break it down)
The church, the chicken shack, the liquor store, the dope house
The bail bonds, the nail salon, the barber shop, the courthouse
The young are blowing their smoke out, he high five
They're 'bout it 'bout it, no power outage for live wires
The block wild and shots fired from hot eyes
A cold world full of hot summers and loud sirens (woo)
The 'caine slangers and gang bangers and lane changers (ha)
Elders anxiety prone, them rigid teenagers
They're whispering:
"Man, you can't save him, the streets raised him"
They on the block like they ain't neighbors
They're straight strangers
Grandmama hit me with 3 words: "Son, keep praying"
This shorty hit me with 3 more, "Son, keep blazing"
They're both deep statements, from two unique places
Real forever real, I just love to hear the streets say it
Corner

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh, uh-uh uh
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner

[Hook]




[Verse 1]
Bad boy is back, back in town
Bow down now
Nine girls, they freak me in the room
I found God
Gimme power, hear my spirit, heavenly lord
Thou shall not
Take my arm and eject your system
Why? Just to make me a victim?
What you want? What you got?
What you got? What you wanted?
I can feel the force take over
From the back to the front
And the boys and the girls from the future
Bring us back all the love
Indigo baby I stuck in the misses
Easier to form the electric connections

[Hook] x3
When you got someone who can fight for you
Give you what you need
Know your every move
Close your eyes and just catch the groove
Take control of me girl, come over me
Baby just set me free
And inject your soul, my heart

[Verse 2]
Right by now, reset your clock
Our time now
Yeah, you was with the shit all summer but
I shall not
Take a look over your shoulders
Girl you give me the blues
When I'm with you I got nothing to lose
And love has been away and confined in the groove
And confined in the groove
And confined in the groove

[Outro] x2
Take control of me girl, come over me
Baby just set me free
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna get you right now
And inject your soul, my heart




[Intro: sample from Kanye West's "Pinocchio Story"]
"Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!"

[Hook: Kanye West sample & B.o.B.]
"Do you really have the stamina?"
Do you have the stamina
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"
Where's my camera
"For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph"
Sign an autograph
"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh "You oughta laugh!"

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Well, posing for pictures and living on a poster
The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure
I ain't always happy, and I ain't always sad
But when the spotlight is on, you have to handle the task
And even the people who swear they love so bad
A go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags
Then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh
And now your whole persona is just a thing of the past
Now, when people see they ignore all the pain
They only think about the rumors and mistakes you made
So that's why I don't read all the comments on the blogs
Everybody's a fan if you boo me or applaud
Now give me your energy, even if you're my enemy
Or trying to be friends with me, aggressively or timidly
Put my next to anyone in this industry
You still will never find someone that's in my league

[Hook: Kanye West sample & B.o.B.]
"Do you really have the stamina?"
Do you have the stamina
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"
Where's my camera
"For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph"
Sign an autograph
"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh "You oughta laugh!"

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Celebrity this, celebrity that
Reality TV fiends addicted like crack and smack
My business is rap, and my business is politicing with that
And then my business is put on the map
Yeah, the bigger I get, the better the hat
The better the slacks, the better the shirts, the more I adapt
The more you pay attention to my sentences
The more you'll realize why I'm a lyricist
And why I sacrifice my time for this experience
And why my album still isn't in your speakers yet
You think you know me now, and you ain't even seen me yet
Well, except maybe on your TV set
Bring the bridge

[35 second Instrumental Break]

{*Scratched: "Bring the bridge"*}

[Hook: Kanye West sample & B.o.B.]
"Do you really have the stamina?"
Do you have the stamina
"For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'"

"For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh "You oughta laugh!"




[Intro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyonce, Andre 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Set the scene, 3000 degrees
I ain't worried about them, fuck niggas over there, but they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter and another homeboy there, nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me, baby, I’ll make it milk till it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for reallo, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot and nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
You talking to me? Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on there ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-
Nute they fell in love with rap black, like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyonce, Andre 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party!

[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)




[Intro: Jay-Z]
Talk to me man…
This ya boy Young Hova, yo, turn the muh'fuckin' noise up
We can get right into the proceedings this evening
Headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit
Okay, now we workin' with it
The boy Face up in Baseline (Face Mob!)
Welcome to New York City
It's ya boy Young Hov' (chyea!)
Kanye West on the track (woo!)
Chi-Town, what’s goin' on now?
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Lemme talk to y'all for a minute
(Just gimme a minute of ya time baby, I don't want much)
Lemme talk to these muh'fuckas, uhh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Guess who's bizack? You still smellin' crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxin' them road; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nuttin' with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt, I emerged from it all
Without a stain on my shirt; you can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm callin' guts every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it, y'all, y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homie, I'm in the drop with the AC off
That's why the streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
'Cause this street shit is all I know

[Verse 2: Scarface]
From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot, a jar and a spoon
Tryin' to make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rock stars and goons
Plain clothes wanna run in my room (woooo!)
But nigga guess who's bizack? It's ya boy Face Mob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah; you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? No
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue and that's on the fo' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make fo' sho' I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war and you ain't makin' a dime (haha!)
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here payin' his dues
My baby walkin', gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues
It's a new game goin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, whoa (haha!)

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Guess who's bizack? The boy B. Mizack, AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gas get clipped
You can make ya chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like old box-spring
Pissy mattress shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like quarter water
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Til' like deuce in the morning, with the old heads (uh!)
Slangin' loose quarters, this Philly cat back at it
Still fuckin' with 'em crack addicts, still bustin' with that black-matic

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
'Cause this street shit is all I know

[Ad-Libs: Swizz Beatz & Jay-Z]
Uh, right, oh, oh
Right (Yeah), one-two, one-two, ay

[Intro: Swizz Beatz, Kanye West & Jay-Z]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(Yeah, yeah)
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(Yeah, uh, yeah)
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25 (Five)
She turned around and looked at me and said “alive”
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(Uh, oh)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Swizz Beatz]
Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes (Right)
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov (Right)
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (Oh)
Work pots and pans (Goddammit), just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died, my daddy did too (Ay)
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that’s why I pray so hard

[Bridge: Kanye West & Jay-Z]
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que será (Welcome to the jungle), get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain, 'fore it goes too far

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Yeah, my dreams is big, reality set in (Yeah)
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon (Yeah)
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn’t make it
I’m a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo)
I died in my sleep, I’m still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah)
Where the fuck is the sun? It’s been a while
Momma, look at ya son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I’m just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I’m so high, where the fuck did I go?
I’m losing myself, I’m stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don’t care, I’m fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Risking my life, I’m already dying, so fuck it, well

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
Goddammit




Yo, I'mma rise to the top cause it ain't in me to fail
Or die bustin' at the cops before they send me to jail
The same nigga ya serve with won't even send you the bail
And sail with some niggas tryin' to send me to hell
So whether
Rap or crack
Beats or streets
This summer I'm rockin' ice to beat the heat
Now I'm gonna cop a Benz 6 and tell 'em "Keep the Jeep
Keep the receipt, keep the change, keep the game."
As long as I keep the fame and keep my name
Kanye to the
Motherfuckin' West
She said, "You from The Outfit?"
I told her, "Motherfuckin' yes."
So every time I spit, it's got to be fresh
So whether freestyle or written
What's the point of rhyme?
I'd rather hear somethin' bitten, as long as it's hittin'
Wack niggas grab my tracks, just get to shittin'
My niggas grab they gats, just get to spittin'
Faggot niggas be like, "Uh huh, no he didn't."
But I did
Ever since I hooked with Syndicate
And shit
I've been blazin' niggas ever since
Ya heard me?
Blazin' niggas ever since

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it; Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever; who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down




[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the sum-time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mi-mink boots in the winter time like Will.I.Am

[Hook]
Let me know if you feel it man
I just messed up on my rap, live TV like damn
But hey, hey here we again yeah
He-here we go again
People talking this but when this hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me
Now break it down

[Verse 2]
Yo, off the top of the dome, dome
Shout out to Chi-town where I call home
Coast to coast, LA to New York to London to Paris
Shout out to Barry
That's my security guard
Cause my rhymes is hard
Listen up I got to praise god
For the number one spot that I got cause I'm hot
And everything I am cause of everything I was not
Cause I never was shot
They said I'd never make raps to hit the block
Or never sold a crack rock
But now everybody on the jock
And I got the game lock
Everybody bring it back
With the rap I don't know how to act I go crazy
Backstage, Beyoncé and Jay-Z
And LeBron and I'm gone
I'm the don, number one
Keep going going on
Got to keep it going on
I keep goin' goin' goin' yeah
I keep flowin' flowin' flowin'
Yo, I meant to freestyle, I meant to mess up
Y'all meant to dress up
Ay yo, I'm fresh up
Who fresher than Mr. West uh
No-no-no-no-nobody I'm talking all y'all right now
The blogs, the blogs
Yo, they try to dis me
But they can not see I'm on Saturday Night getting busy
Y'all wish ya can be me, hey mama can you see me?
Hey daddy can you see me?
I'm rocking on your TV
Y'all thought they'd never let me back in NBC, see?
La La La Laaaa

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh, uh
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
(Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word—haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping Rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga, shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetite's had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble, retracing my steps

[Sampled Intro]
Alright, is everybody ready? (YEAHHH!)
Alright now here we go!

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Aiyyo good morning America, good morning to Erika
Who gave me good head while watching Good Morning America
Good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood lookin for good yay to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy with good lies lookin' liable to try
You know that old sayin, what they say about good guys
I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed hits bad, so they hittin licks bad
Had to get that work off, before that shit went bad
If not it gets bad, and things'll only get bad
So now I'm gettin bad scans, and I got that bad jam
Tellin me them bad sense, songs catch them bad breaks
Caught a bad rate on the whip, with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly and my chain's ugly
Things became ugly cause my ugly rugby
Got a stain and it's musty, wakin up lookin crusty
And Ms. Thang who's ugly is sayin to me don't touch me
I went from Pretty Willie to pretty silly without the pretty gully
So you know things'll still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly

[Hook: Kanye West]
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get your money ain't no tellin they gon' love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got, to love me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning to umm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah, she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin, she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone, cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise, she said I ain't bonin you
With them too long shoes, and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So I'mma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said 'Ye, you don't love me?
I told her it was good, it's too bad it got ugly

[Hook: Kanye West]
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get your money ain't no tellin they gon' love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got, to love me

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Aiyyo good morning to Queens, the Northside is my scene
And when it comes down to it I'mma ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but these bills'll make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcin and it's ugly
Now my mindstate is ugly, when blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready turn it up in these streets, and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Ugly's with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bum me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly then leave the bar, abruptly
But I took it all back, cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin my bad words and say that's a bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chick with a bad perm
Who case took a bad turn, her face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about the bitch is bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad luck, our son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad luck
And once you get bad, it be bad for good
And that's bad meanin bad not bad meanin good
But I agree that it's good, when you leave with the goods
It's all good in the hood I call good cause it's good
Now I'm havin some good nights, livin this good life
Got me a good girl that I'mma make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Cause my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came off for good, offa good behavior
Spittin that good game so what's good with this paper
Cause this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly

[Hook: Kanye West]
Aiyyo we showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get your money ain't no tellin they gon' love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got, to love me




[Verse 1: Sting]
Just a castaway
An island lost at sea
Another lonely day
With no one here but me
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair

[Chorus: Sting]
I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle

A year has passed since I wrote my note
But I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart

[Chorus: Sting]

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Ugh, damn
Yo, it's the top of the mornin'
And I'm just wakin' up, breath stinkin' and yawnin'
Ugh, last night I performed at a show
Now I'm laid up with this chick I don't know
All I know is I was drinkin' on Red Bull and Hennessy
Then you approached me and said you was feelin' me
Plus you said you had some weed to spark
So I took you to my room at the Adams Mark
Ugh, you was just another chick that I left wit'
Had sex wit' real quick and I slept wit'
And I know that it's a God damn shame
But baby girl I don't remember yo' name
What's yo' name again?

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs + Alicia Keys]
I'm for real man I don't be rememberin' these girls' names dog
You don't know my name
For real, if I remember yo' name you special
I swear, it feels like ooooo
I'm sorry, you know what I'm sayin'?
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?
This is Freddie Gibbs, this is how I am

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo, I remember yo' name, is it Dana, Lisa, or Amanda?
Erica, Tiffany, Neisha, or Cassandra
She said: "no, my name is Tiana"
Go call them other bitches' names out to yo' mama
Woah, baby girl let's be friends not enemies
You can't get mad cause I got a bad memory
But now it's checkout time, so baby check this
Get dressed, I'mma take you to breakfast
And maybe we can come back to the tele
We can roll another blunt and listen to R. Kelly
Then we can do the same thang again
But baby girl what's yo' name again?
I forgot, ugh

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs + Alicia Keys]
It feels like ooh-ooh-ooh
You don't know my name
I'm sorry you know what I'm sayin'?
I was drunk, I was drinkin' that Henn-dog
And I swear it baby
It feel like ooooo
It was me, Ivoe, [?] you was talkin' to all of us
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go, will you ever know
They don't, they don't know yo' name either
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sayin', he don't  even know what he's doin' to me
Yes I do
I be feelin' all crazy inside, I'm feelin' like

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
Cause did I mention you're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'
Cause my lovin' feels like ooooo
You don't know my name

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs + Alicia Keys]
You tell me one more time I'm gon' remember it, I promise
Round and round and round we go, will he ever know?
And I swear it feel like ooooo
For real?
You don't know my name
I'm tellin' you, when I get-. when I'm off that green and that drink
Round and round and round we go, will he ever know?
You know, I be, I be forgettin' stuff
Will you ever know it?

[Outro: Freddie Gibbs + Tiana]
And I can't believe you forgot my name
Man I'm tellin' you I'm sorry you know Brianna it be like that
You ain't sorry nigga, my name is not Brianna
What's yo' name?
Tiana!
Tiana, Tiana
Tiana, Tiana, Tiana
Man, just like I said, you know I really care about you-
You don't care about me, you were screamin' that name last night
It's about to be me and you girl, Freddie-
No it ain't, whatever
Freddie, Freddie and Kiana baby, Freddie and Kiana
Tiana!
Oh my fault, I ain't mean to do that

You know, I know you love me, you love me don't you?
Tell the truth, I know you love me

I told you
What is it?
Leanna, it's gon' be all good
Tiana!
Oh, well I'm Freddie Gibbs, I'm pretty sure you know that
What's my name?
I forgot *laughs*




[Verse: Kanye West]
I walk through the halls of the school and it’s cool to be known by many for my rapping ability
But what about the brothers who ain’t got it like me
Making money off the trade
You could say I had it made
Drugs are on the rise
And it’s not a big surprise
You see no soul in a young brother’s eyes
Trying to be hard by the streets, but the streets kinda hard
But here's another factor we wanna disregard
Black-on-black is a stab in my back
It really hurts my soul when I hear about that




Intro: Talib Kweli:

ALRIGHT

In case y'all don't know, he did H to the Izzo, he did Takeover, he did Guess Who's Back, he did my joint, Good to You, he did [?]give it up for my nigga Kanye West, you know what I'm saying?

Now Kanye, y'all also don't know my man got skills, he's a rapper, he's on my projects, so I want him to bust a verse, can we let my man bust a verse?

What's up Kanye what's up?

Kanye West:

They gonna play my beat, they gonna play my beat?

Talib Kweli:

Yeah Yeah, chops

Verse 1: Kanye West

Woooooo

Mic check, mic check

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean two platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all

Hook:  Kanye West / Talib Kweli

Talib Kweli:

New York City here! New York City here!

Kanye West:

Its like, guess who's bizzack, back on the track with the blow
Kanye to-the, representing his gold
I guess who's come back, better than I suppose
Heard those beats, shit it's all I know
Guess who's bizzack, [?]
The Roc' is definitely in the building
Back on the track, yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse 2: Talib Kweli

It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!
Damn, New York City in the house!
Talib Kweli gotta tell you what it's about
Because my man Kanye from the Chi' will say hi
Wave your hands from side to side
Mos Def, Kweli, [?]
[?]
I got my man, he represent the [?] projects
[?]

Verse 3: Mos Def

I say guess who's bizzack, Kweli, Kanye, and Mos
Punk niggas getting way too close
[?] Broadway doing them all day
Niggas [?] but don't take it the wrong way
[?]
Doing Iving Plaza, causing disaster
You bring the time but we bring the prescription
Pick up your ears so you all could listen
[?]

Outro: Kanye West

I be killin these niggas on this lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips
And since takeover, it seems like the whole hood want to get a Jimmie Jones makeover
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever

My man!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
First of all, I wanna thank my connect
The most important person, with all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash (Okay!)
Boys in blue who put greed before the badge (Okay!)
The first pusher who ever made the stash (Okay!)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)
Oh, what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change, I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor, rapping at your eulogy
To Lil' Kim and them, you know the women-friend who
Carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you: the customer

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
The Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)
Oh what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)

(We in the house, hou-, hou-, HEY)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score
Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore
Take what the Forbes figured, then figure more
'Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw
Pick a time, let's pick apart some stores
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
I figure frauds never hit a lick before
So they don't know the feeling when them things get across
Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
Feel the Porsche, hit defrost
Ice-cold, jewels got no flaws
Drop got no top, you on the top floor
Pink Rosé, think OJ
I get away with murder when I sling yay
Her-on got less steps than Britney
That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Rare Porsches, rare portraits
Rare guns if you dare come near the fortress
This apple sauce is from the apple orchard
This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses
Which means I get it from the ground
Which means you get it when I'm around
Rich niggas, black Bar Mitzvahs
Mazel tov, it's a celebration bitches!
"L'chaim!"
I wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time
Cheers, toast to crime
Number one D-boy, shame he could rhyme

[Intro]
Angel, angel
Angel, angel

[Verse 1: Common]
I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good
Things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

[Verse 2: The Game]
Th-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance and she took Big down
I should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around
An angel

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

[Verse 3: The Game]
Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin
"Didilly whoooa!", I got love for the streets
Peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

[Outro: Common]
Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene
L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy
We do it forever, yeah




[Intro]
She finally made it. The stars are out tonight. Ooooh weee!

[Hook: Kanye West]
Big screen
Hollywood lights
She wants the big screen
Hollywood lights
She wants it

[GLC]
At first came the breast and then the dookie chain
Got a little hoochie game and then the Gucci came
The Ultima and then the Mustang
Lookin' in the mirror, "Aye" she must say
Diane Keaton
A gangster she was seekin'
With two then the three can keep a secret
Bein' exposed to the goals of a baller
So she drove a Rolls with a Prada
Put up the ?, rocked Fendi
Rarely Ed Hardy she said the shit was trendy
Married to the mob like she was Miss Wendy
She would spend the bread of men instead of spendin'
Her own, her tone was eccentric
The Gulf coast was home for this mistress
Felt pain, but shoppin' killed this
Then a little bit of Wayne lent her something for this princess

[Hook]

[Kanye West]
Baby girl you're dangerous
Everybody know that you love those lights
Baby girl you're dangerous
So dangerous, but it's only right
I'm back in your life
Return Of The Jedi
L.A. for a night, then return on the red eye
It's a party in your closet
I swear it's going off
I see it's Dolce & Gabbana
Viktor & Rolf
Ann Roth
Uh, huh
Not to shabby
You're good around celebs, not too laughy
So you deserve a rapper and/or athlete
And/or something more than just a backseat
Action, I had more beats than I had rhymes
Now they say you got more girls than you got time
To spend with 'em
So I throw them all on the team
Only problem is, I see they all want a ring, ring
Let me tell you once ting
It's gonna take a lot to be down with the king, king
Down, down with the king
Now are you really ready for the big screen?

[Hook]




The Roc is in the building

Homgirl Mela

So I don't miss a thing


[Kanye West]
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children
Hear barbershop talk, niggas want to kill him
Throw my hoodie on, blend in like chameleons
Take my hoodie off, they like "What up Ye, you chillin'?"
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween, minus the costumes
The nigga that's flickin' be the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' be the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationships, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans most recent
Throw Jordans on the truck now just to look decent
Just for me and Mela, dirt to [??]

[Intro: Kanye West]
She really thought that? (Yeah)
Yeah, she's so paranoid (Yeah, that's good, paranoid)
Girls gonna love this song, ahaha
Why are you so paranoid? (Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Don't be so paranoid, don't be so

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Hey there, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good
Might do us good 'fore we be done for good
'Cause I could make it good, I could make it hood
I could make you come, I could make you go
I could make you high, I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky, hey, maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checkin' through my cell phone, baby, no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight, oh, here we go (Oh, here we go)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway, they don't know you (They don't know) like I do
They'll never know you (Never know)
Anyway, they don't know you (Never know) like I do
They'll never know you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me, show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look
Baby, let 'em look, give ya cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry, we're closed

[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Baby, don't worry about it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Travie!
(Uh-oh)
Pete, thought I told you
What up, Hemmy
I see you!

[Verse 1: McCoy]
I've had the world at arm's length from the get-go
This ain't an arms race, it's Apocalypto
The industry's a target, I suggest these labels get low
On top of that, this track is cracked like burnt brillo (damn)
Consider me the beast of Easter leavened
VIP, all day, AK47
If words is weapons, then get to steppin'
My arsenal's enough to send Hell's Angels to Heaven
I'm cool as the Fonz, and deadly as Charles Bronson
I'm Gonzo, you can call me Travie S. Thompson
Go 'head, and you can choose a similar path
But don't gas yourself up like Sylvia Plath, jeez
Watch Travie take the title with ease
You want a verse, please, I wouldn't bless you if you sneezed
(Achoo!) Pardon me, I'm allergic to bullshit
Got a God complex with a full clip, pow!

[Verse 2: Tyga]
The leader, man; Tyga-man make you leave your man
Ladies man take your mate
Literally, this song got me checking out my range
With no piff involved, my swag flyer than a plane
With the unruly attitude; ignorant, arrogant dude
Excuse me, I'm only seventeen (that's my age)
"You're excused, I like your honesty, honestly
You're more mature than the average teen" (oh, shah)
"And uh, your label family? You must have a team" (yeah)
Decaydance, preferably, that'll be next for me (hint-hint)
The rest'll be history, plat-i-um until they stop listening
Then your baby's back like ribs (ribs)
I know you've been missing me, I almost forgot to mention it
Ever heard a sound like this? (wow!)

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race!
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race!
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race!
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

[Chorus: Stump]
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now I don't know what the hell this song is talkin' bout
Do you?
She said "Yeah, I been spendin' all day tryna figure that out"
You too?
The arms race made 'em raise they arm
And race straight to the top; Who knew? (who knew?)
Right now they got that number one spot
Do you want that? (want that?) Me too
One thing I gotta call out, boy, take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they ain't black, when they get money they don't ball out, boy
They just buy tight jeans till their nuts hang all out, boy
They figure 'Ye dress tight so we gonna dress tighter
He dress white so we gone dress whiter
So in spite of anything you might've
Seen or heard, this scene occurred, word

[Chorus: Stump]
I’m a leading man (I'm a leading man)
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate

[Verse 4: Paul Wall & Skinhead Rob]
Ha, come on, expensive taste, we up in a arms race
Big money, big crib, big Cadillac (sho')
Big daddy, boy, I cop big dro sacks (that's right)
Paper stack, big ring, big bling-bling (c'mon)
Try to take big chain, big bang-bang (pow!)
I'm going (whoa), I'm going (whoa), I'm motherfucking gone
Ain't no signs that I'm slowing though I'm knowing that I'm wrong
Bring it on, out to get it, I need cash by the stacks
I need a new pair of Stacys and a dash for the 'Lac, jack
Ha, hear that? Top back [?] grill (grill)
Coming down on the spiderweb chrome wheels (trill)
First place in the stunting race, top notch (ha)
Paint drip-drop, flip-flop, strapped with a Glock
Live every day like it's my last one; maybe it is
And ain't no morrows in my world of sorrow; maybe in his
I break ribs, break laws, break jaws at most
I still stick to the coast, hold up and reload
OH!

[Verse 5: Lupe Fiasco]
There's an arms race, like I'm runnin' on my hands
A dance marathon on my napalms, and
Drop mine's first so that they bombs can't
And Glocks, lasers, missiles, beat rocks, paper, scissors
I built mine's big, better build yours bigger
Built mine's quick so I could kill yours quicker
The number one supplier, the world's largest equipper
The second smallest dier, best non-coexister
I pledge allegiance to gasoline and bulletproof limousines
And leans on the property of the poor
And every night, I pray to the Lords Of War
Every man and mac eleven
That all good child rebel soldiers go to AK-47 heaven
And a landmine in every playground that they step in
And you took the footage from the camera on the tips
Of our bullets, and record like former Darfur [push it]

[Chorus: Stump]
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, it's Weezy, baby!
I am your arms dealer, I'm more like an armed dealer
Liter-rally, really, I don't get this song neither
But I'mma figure it out like a palm reader
And, since I be on TV, I turn it on to see me!
Hey, I'm so cool, even I wanna be me
That was totally off the subject
But for me, every song is like pussy so fuck it
Like Fresh, you dug it (you dug it, you dug it)




[Intro: Kanye West & Lil Wayne]
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I got the right, to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight, is better tonight
And I might, see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got my life, and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door
Door, door, door, door
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Okay, I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you 'cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay, I got you out my mind
And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well, now you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody, everybody that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I got the right, to put up a fight
But not quite, 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight, is better tonight
And I might, see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how did you'd get there?
'Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Baby girl I'm finished, I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented, I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it, and now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision, look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you, girl we through
You think your shit don't stank but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know, that you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know, that you know




Yo, we made this joint, we was like, "We gotta get Preemo to scratch on this shit, seriously." Cause, that's one of my idols, just a legend in the game, a living legend. And then, plus, he, he like porn a lot, so I relate to him with that, you know. And he been to the AVN's, you know. I been to the Grammy's, he been to the AVN's, you know. I'm, and, actu- I'm envious of him, cause Rick Rubin, he actually asked me to go to the AVN's, and I was like, "Man, I can't do it. I just made 'Jesus Walks'. They gon' see me, and they gon' take away my NAACP award." So I was, uh, you know, I have to watch pornos in the privacy of my own home, you know? I really want to go AVN's, but, you know, I can't do it, cause they'll take me off the cover of Jet, and then what? Now I won't make it on the cover of Essence. But one day, one day I'll be there. I'ma have one on of them BAPE hoodies zipped-up with the eyes cut out and some, some gloves with the fingers cut off so I could feel, too, so I could touch. You know they let celebrities touch. That's how it be whenever you go to the strip club, "No touching!  Except for you, 'Ye, you can do whatever you want."

I–I–I–I–I'm in that two-seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (swerve) (believe)
O–o–o–o–o–okay, Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (swerve)
I–I–I–I–I'm in that two-seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (swerve)

[Refrain: Fuzzy Jones & Big Sean]
Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' (swerve)
And a gnashin' of teeth (swerve)
It is a weepin' and a mournin' (swerve)
And a gnashin' of teeth (swerve)
It is a— when it comes to my sound (swerve)
Which is the champion sound (swerve)
Believe, believe (swerve)
Believe, believe (swerve)
Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a— when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe, believe, believe, believe




[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[interlude: Kanye West]
Hehe
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Music! Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people kids
I hate plastic couches in other people cribs
I hate when other people cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said, "I just cleaned up, baby, I can't tell"
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God damn cucumber Bath and Body Works?
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the La-Di-Da-Di verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I scored, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing (Hah), pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Ehh)
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Never mind me, 'Ye, have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'ma take, I'ma take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Rosé and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone
The real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights, baby, that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Yeah)
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's G.O.O.D. Music in the house
And we got... Keri!

[Bridge: Keri Hilson & Kanye West]
Boy, I know you the one that I heard about (Hah)
And I know you workin' with it through word of mouth
Looks like I'ma have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta
Take it for the team (Hah)
Take it for the team
Take it for the team (I like your mentality, baby)
Take it for the team (Hahahahaha)

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
(CyHi!) I'm blowin' on stinky that come in a jar
(CyHi!) Playin' with her kitty, made her come in the car
(CyHi!) She a redbone but her cousin is dark
(CyHi!) A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complainin' 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying to fuck, she talkin' 'bout she want to eat first
I'm like, "Why did this bitch have to bring her?"
Tryin' to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said, "I got a chick for you that look like a singer
On a scale of one to ten, she's a fifteen-er"
Man, you shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team, she would be a fifth-stringer
I said, "I got the fine one in the Bimmer
I'm the point guard and I need a wing, take it for the team"

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Fridays
I'ma take this one for the team

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
It's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet I'm gon' sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her friend bust in, goddamn, who brought the raccoon out?
For the team, uh

[Break: Kanye West]
Like we always do at this time
Like, like we always do at this time
I go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Hah, like we always do at this time
Southside, we gon' set this party off right
This time
This time
Yeah, yeah
Mike Dean on the keys
Hey, oh

[Outro: Kanye West]
They love to hate
Bad model bitches, they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check-check-check my swag and get up to date
Aye, it's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches, they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check-check-check my swag and get, uh, aye




[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay I’m chillin’ in my camo, flippin’ through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo’s a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, this ammunition I’m pitching
To make your body switch another position
And listen, my weed loud, fuck her and speed off
Tell 'em I bare arms, I'm cuttin my sleeves off
Lettin' my tats show and I sag my pants
Im letting my ass show, I'm hot as tabasco
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba
Inside of the car is like a damn computer
Inside of the crib is like a damn museum
You ain't seen these before, you better get 'em on film
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim
Disrespect, you stomp em out, man give em a Tim
You ain't did what I did, see I know I'mma win
And they dont have slow-motion so I did it again
Woah!

[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay I'm sittin' on the plane, flying over graves
I am so high, nigga I can talk to rain
My outfit's insane, ain't that evident?
My chain had another chain like it was pregnant
My favorite dish is turkey lasagna
Even my pajamas designer
She got a fat ass I make her rewind
Back seat so big I press recline
Got a dirty sprite in my cup holder
Rappers like road kill, they get run over
They get done over, it's just one solider
This flow will make you fall like its October
Me and your girl, nigga opposite of sober
Celine Paris chain charm look like a cobra
Young Casanova, Baby Romeo
I got my girl geeked, she look like she from Tokyo

[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!




[Intro: Jay-Z]
Geah.. whassup?
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B, here's mine
Geah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
See I was born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming "Don't do it!"
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like "Damn, I'ma be a failure"
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister goin' make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you lookin at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me
Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Life.. yeah.. uhh..
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst.. of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life...

[Verse: Kanye West]
Born in the nation that breeded us
Why they don't never show me the love?
Jesus Shuttlesworth, I lead the squad
Walk on water while I feed the sharks
Everybody just got made alert (Tiimmy)
You might get killed on your way to work
Everyone seen it in broad day
Nobody feelin' that paperwork
Nobody cared, that just made it worse
All of the talkin' just made it worse
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy, too turnt up
Grab the burner, leave the block burnt up
Now look what you made me do
Look who you made me shoot
Don't ask for help from dude
That nigga crazy too
I'm the new Steve, mixed with Ali
'Bout to get freed, I'm the new Walt
Fuck what you thought

Cause Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy, too turnt up
Grab the burner, leave the block burnt up
Grab the burner, leave the block burnt up

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin’
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I’m a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say
"Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don’t you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Keri Hilson]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please don’t mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can’t let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I’m mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Hook]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Outro: Keri Hilson]
Knocks you down




[Chorus: Kanye West]
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Bridge: Kanye West]
La La La La La
Off MTV
La La La La La
When you gonna go out with Me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill You could be Lauryn Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'mma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now y'all just prayin

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Verse 3: Common]
You was a vic in high school, now you a thug?
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price
On the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggas see the light, got fat girls eating right

[Outro: Kanye West & Common]
Haha, we in this bitch, yeah
Hahaha
It's Common and Kanye
Y'all niggas know what time it is, motherfuckers
Chi-Town, DJ Pharris
Heavy Hitters what up?
Mike Love What Up?
DJ Enuff
Pharrell! That's my favorite producer by the way
That's why I had to rap on this
'Cause is tracks is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
Just Blaze tracks is better than yours
You can have one but we all gonna

Yo G, Hop, we taxin these niggas right now
Plain Pat What Up? That's all




[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Yo, I did some things but that's the old me
Now you wanna keep me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend; I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why does she be so mad at me for?
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talkin', talkin', talkin' tall
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
You just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
So imma take off tonight
Into the night

[Chorus]
I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so...
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?




[Intro: Kanye West]
DJ, offbeat
Remember when I was off-earth
The trip
Yeah, um
She look, she look good as a motherfucker
But I can't remember her name
I can’t remember her name for nothing
Look, you took her number down right?
You took her number down right?
Know what? I'm just gonna go ahead and call this girl
Hello, what's up? It’s Kanye
Nah it's really me
You know who I am?
I don't usually do this but
I'm only going to be in town for one night
I want to know if you want to come by the room or something
Would that be cool?
Ok, cool, cool
Come around
Ok, ok let me take your coat
You think I'm gonna massage or something
Ok, ok, that's what I thought
I'm trying to say, I'm trying to say what’s up
You know, I’m saying, um
Wait a second, you came too honey
It's that time of the month
Oh man
Will you tell me
I ain’t playing, this is what I want you to say
But we got to, we got to put down something
Um, um, all we ask is that we pay what we done
It's like

[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
But I still don't know your name girl
Wherever we go, she be going home
I swear it feels like Wooo, ooh, ooh
And I still don't know your name
Falling down, I been on, she be all alone




[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
Anyone but him
I'd rather hear you'd have the whole football team
Than have to watch his filthy lips on your skin
Anyone but him
Anyone but him
With school boy fists, we can take this outside
But knowing my luck, that fuck would win
Anyone but him

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it

[Verse 2: Mr. Hudson]
Anyone but him
My blood boils as my eyes turn green
Is this the best of the best of the scene?
Anyone but him
Anyone but him
With school boy fists, we can take this outside
But knowing my luck, that fuck would win
Anyone but him

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it

[Verse 3: Mr. Hudson]
Anyone but him
Look past the leather, and the dash, and the rims
And you'll see his whole hustle wears thin
Anyone but him
Anyone but him
He's gonna take what you can't take back
Then he's gone out the door on a whim
Anyone but him

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it isn't me

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Uh, yeah, yeah
Now once she go black, she ain't never coming back
I'm sorry Mr. H, I thought you already knew that
You will see her on a black street like Chauncey
I'm a bad boy like Sean C
Rock a fella like Shawn C
Keep them Apes with me like Don C
Like Jay, keep Beyoncé
I'm just talking nonsense
So nonchalantly
See my Mark like Ronsy
Pop my collars like Fonzy
Paparazzi is on me
I see your girl want me, I'm filling up her glass
Feeling on her ass, feeling so upper class
And your boy so fresh, I might even flash cash
So at the end of the night, you ain't even gotta ask

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it isn't me

[Outro: Mr. Hudson & Kanye West]
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me
Who's gonna take you home?
If it isn't me, if it isn't me, if it isn't me




It's ya boy, Kanye To The
The roc is in the building.. Hey hey

Chorus (John Legend):
You know that you wanna be down now
So come on lets stop playing around now
Act grow for once, lets go
Come on baby, lets go

Verse 1 (Kanye West):
Have an affair be an adult for once
How about a car run in a store for??
Roll a lil' weed a lil' Hennessy
Lets see will the rest develop like Tennessee
Kill tha back and forth
All that knee comin on her, you backin off
Cuz the second I spit game too long
You'll run and tell ya friends he came on way too strong
The he say, she say just like junior high
So if I smash you would lie and say you was high
And if you freaky you'll blame it on ya B-Day
But how do you explain f**on the freeway
Listen, you ain't gotta lot of kick it
I ain't gotta lot of stick it
This is me K
Move ya body now victim to the D. J
And in the morning we gon have amnesia
So for now lets take it to max like T. J., hey!

Chorus:

Verse 2 (Young Chris):
Face in the pillow she moaned while I hit it
Tight bra opposite thong kinda kiddish
All I need is for to be grown
You try to visit my home
I don't usually show em how I'm living
I roam and once I get em I bone
I neva hit up they phone
I leave em sittin alone soakin the sheets up
Think she gon ride in the "V" smokin my reefer
Blowin my beeper hopin that I skeet up in that
I been strapped a pair for tha???
Bought a bib just in case she don't swallow it's for tha kids
I'm all in the middle, she hollerin it's in my ribs
I'm hopin that her nigga ain't follow us to the crib
Cuz it could get ugly I promise you where I live
These niggas get to buggin
????
That's why I keep it real wit all mine from tha start
Cuz Jay say love em wit ya mind not ya heart

Chorus:

Verse 3 (Young Neef):
Yo, I guess when you young you like em old
And when you old you like em young
You understand where I'm coming from
I guess not, you betta listen and watch and stop talkin
Cuz black girls lost, it happens often
Need to step up to the plate and get ya weight up
Where ya jeans a lil' bit tighter and fix ya make-up
I don't want a roughneck but can't be shook
She got ta love the kids and know how to cook
From time to time, she could get a library look
She gotta be sophisticated and loyal
I love em down to earth but I can't stand em spoiled
Especially when they straight from tha hood
Neva been to cali but she actin hollywood
Runnin 'round town like she know what's good
You eva heard tha sayin mami "do as you should"
And if you ain't listen, you gon wish that would.. Yep!

Chorus:




[Intro]
I ain't innocent, Jesus walked me to the Grammys
Thank you God, now I can sin again!

[Verse 1]
I had the "Jesus Walks" sample and a dope idea
If K hook it up then this could be the song of the year
So I give my nigga the sample and the joint took off
But the verse that 'Fest did somehow got lost
Somewhere got tossed
Homie, I ain't mad at ya, doin' your thing
Let every man be his own king
With no fear ladies and gents, what you finna hear
"Jesus Walks" Rhymefest verse world premiere

[Hook]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way cause the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
And the only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Verse 2]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where coppin' that work is your best investment
And none of my niggas gonna answer questions
'Cause none of my niggas know who the feds is
We hustle hard for dollars like we grew up checkless
Pops wasn't around, mom's smokin' the breakfast
Before I sold weed, we was roach infested
The two girls downstairs was both molested
I promise if I ever made it out of this hellhole
I wouldn't sell blows, I would just sell flows
My niggas had Nikes, I had Pro Wings shell toes
Kids knew it was Payless, Footlocker ain't sell those
I got a girl that ain't my girl
That got my baby so she bug me
She ain't even cute so my baby prolly ugly
Man sometimes I feel like God don't love me
Maybe the problem is I don't love me
My granny think I'm crazy, the streets is a virus
Sometimes I just want to rest in peace like Osiris
Wait, rest in peace like Osiris




[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really really wanna catch your eye
There's something special ’bout you
I must really like you
There's not a lotta guys are worth my time
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin’ kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear, it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You’re doin’ everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination’s runnin' wild

[Chorus]
It feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
(’Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Bridge]
"I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin like, "Oww! (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention?
You're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'

[Chorus]
'Cause my lovin' feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Post-Chorus]
Will you ever know it?
No no no no no, no no
Will you ever know it?

[Spoken Interlude]
"I'm gonna have to just go ahead and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to -- to Michael?
Oh hey, how you doin'?
Uh, I feel kinda silly doin' this, but uhh...
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
'N your cuff links are shining all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time, but...
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah
So, what day did you say?
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man"

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

[Outro]
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)




[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown - you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep my-self, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, we can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I’m bout to go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Hook]

So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown
So keep your love locked down, so keep your love lockdown

Is anybody in the house right now in love right now?
In love right now, well keep your love lockdown
If anybody in the house right now is in love right now
Try your best to keep your love lockdown
Keep your love lockdown
Keep it on

Is it better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all?

This brings us to the end of my VH1 Storyteller
Thank you for
Being my shrink today and the stage as my couch
Thank you for allowing me to get some things off my chest and out of my mind
The ghosts out of my head so they will not haunt me at night
And just for this moment as I hear clap and hear you scream, just for this moment
I feel alright

My pain shall be your pleasure, my torment and tragedy

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?
Where’s the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Running for the finish line
Running for the finish line
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
Are we at the finish line?
You run for the finish line
You run for the finish line
I’m not ready to fi-finish life
But I’m on the finish line
So I run from the finish line
I run from the finish line
‘Cause I’m not ready to finish life
I gotta run from the finish life

So keep your love lockdown, so keep your love
You keep your love
We’re low…

Not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, no, no, noo
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret cold
So everybody else don’t have to know

So keep your love lockdown
You keep your love lockdown [3x]

So keep your love lockdown [3x]
You keep your love lockdown and you lose

Is anybody in the house right now that’s in love right now?
You gotta keep your love locked down, you gotta keep your love
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Please, please, promise me
Please, promise me, please
That you will keep your love lockdown
Just try to keep your love lockdown

You don’t want to make the music
I’m forced to make right now
I know it sounds good and all
But I would rather have my love lockdown
That number one hit don’t mean shit
If it’s nobody to celebrate with
To celebrate with, to levitate with

You gotta keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
You lose

[Intro:]
Ain't nobody lookin' like you do
Ain't nobody lookin' like you do
Ain't nobody lookin' like you do
Ain't nobody lookin' like you do




[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Intro]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind

[Chorus]
Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus]
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 2]
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say "Hova!" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants "HO-VA! HO-VA!"]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

[Outro]
(What the hell are you waiting forrrr?)
[piano plays out as crowd cheers loudly]




[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

[Verse 1]
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
What's up? Cats all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young cats gettin' at me, young rappers spittin' at me
My homie Big predicted this thing exactly
"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"- gotta move carefully
Cause cat hate when you getting money like athletes
Young'ns ice-grilling me, ohh - you not feeling me?
Fine; it cost you nothing - pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for fronting
Sensitive thugs, they all need hugs
Damn little man I'm just trying do me
If the record's two mil you know I'm trying move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, yo I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing
Where's the love?

[Hook (Jaguar Wright)]
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)

[Verse 2]
And then the Fugees gonna break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got something to say
What's all the fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
They pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound boy
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya
I thought I told you cats I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96
That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz
I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam
Jigga held you down 6 summers; damn, where's the love?

[Hook (Jaguar Wright)]
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
Ok I feel you ma, I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Everybody let's take em to church
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city
Ain't no love, in the heart of town)

[Verse 3]
Then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up and Ike and Tina
Turner
Break up then I wake up to more bullsh
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this sh
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
What you mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?
Nigga respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me sh - where's the love?

[Hook]
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no love in the heart of town)
Ain't no
I like that start again
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no ain't no ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
(Ain't no)

[Outro]
Everybody give it up for Jagwar Wright come on
That's all you baby that's all you
That's all Jay
Yeah right




Shoutout to Reflex for bringing me this sample. Any and everybody who helped with the Be album, we brought back that real hip-hop shit. This is one of the greatest times of my life. You know we workin' on a new joint "Finding Forever" right now, be in stores this summer. Depending on what year you're listening to this mixtape, it might've been in stores last summer, depending on what year that is. I won't say the year because Extra P told me don't say the year. So from now, till forever baby "Finding Forever". Hi boys and girls, I always wanted to say that over this sample, I have nothing else to say though. Hooooo!




[Intro: Randy Cain & Ghostface Killah]
Damn
And oh, you're gonna love me
I don't understand why we go through this over and over and over and over again
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
What's really good

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor & Ghostface Killah]
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean (True)
We do things in between the lines
We should do more than stand out (I agree)
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shining star

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Ghostface Killah]
I wanna spend my nights with you (Spend my life with you too)
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home (Of Course)
I know that you're all alone
Thinking 'bout what you gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain & Ghostface Killah]
And oh, you're gonna love me
I'ma love you regardless
You're gonna wanna hug me
We just gotta cut this shit out
And squeeze me
Yeah

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo; We used to spin back Lovin' You, Minnie Riperton
The Bose speakers had my walls and the plaques tremblin'
"La la la la la" played in my mind all day
You come home, I let Calgon take you away
Bubble baths arose, Gucci open toes
Sunday nights we sit and watch Power in our robes
All of a sudden our lines got crossed, over nothin'
A text and your attitude changed, yo, you buggin'!
Hit me in the face with a pillow and threw somethin'
I just got up and walked in the room, you still cussin'
No, I love you's before we sleep
'Good night's is out the window it lasts for weeks
It's been a while since I gave you my street vows
Promise to love you and hit it two times a day, never cheat now
Our chemistry is like a bowl of cherries
And I'm the chocolate I smother you, never to worry

[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain & Ghostface Killah]
And oh, you're gonna love me
I'ma take half the blame for this problem we goin' through
You're gonna wanna hug me
You know I'm a Taurus, the bull, I'm stubborn
And squeeze me
So tell me what's on your mind

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch
When we're laying right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinking understanding
Don't let a feeling change it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Method Man]
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone (Cash tricks)
I ain't got time haha
Thinking 'bout what I'm gon' do
Yeah, yeah
I hope that I see it through, ooh, ooh
Look, look, look

[Verse 4: Method Man]
I ain't got time for tricks, them broads ain't loyal
I get a Spanish chick, I make arroz con pollo
Keep my woman fresh so she will never be spoiled (Nah!)
And she can be my queen but we will never be royals
I don't give ya cream, ya'naw mean, but I assure you
I'm Heavy with the D, I got Nuttin' But Love for you
Sex as a weapon, got nothin' but slugs for you
Ain't no protection, I done shot up the club for you (Pew, pew)
Yeah, If I adore you, mi amor you
These dudes cannot afford you, let the god Couture you
Yeah, I like 'em loyal from the soil
And rhetorical questions when we smash, adorable
Who put the sex in sex appeal?
Shorty got a receipt, but her ex gets the bill
Look, I'm too grown for Netflix and chill
But I G and post up like a net flick for real
And you love me

[Post Chorus: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor & Raekwon]
And are you gonna love me? yeah
And are you gonna hold me? And squeeze me
Are you gonna love?
Yeah, man
And squeeze me
You know what it is, ma

[Verse 5: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
Chef AKA the wedding crasher came through in the Cullinan
Color of skim milk, the wrath of somethin'
Us in the corner with the paid face, black cards, and Louis faces, African cousins with us, we niggas
Smokin' blunts, wine, that's Licataa
I waited like three years, now we here gettin' licenses
I'm tired of the whole Jack and Jill shit, the real shit
Both of us comfortable now, so you don't ever gotta feel shit
Feed a nigga, laugh for hours
Count my ones, playin' old school shit while we fuck in the shower
Now you know your God is top tier
Remember the message, love with capital letters until they dead us

[Outro: Teyana Taylor & Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
Are you gonna hold me
And squeeze me, squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
You're gonna wanna hold me
And squeeze me, and squeeze me




[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
Bounce my nigga
You dont want no beef with these Chi-town niggas
You ain't got the phlegm for the four-pound spitters
Underground underneath everything that glitters
Still gold, still selling 500 thousand
Not satisfied 'till we push another thousand
Park the vehicle right in front of public housing
So the shorties with nigga half
Thye get out the brown and
Run a little math and
Count that paper
Balls so hard they bounce back later
Have green parties but not Ralph Nader
Black like Darth Vader
You know me, ain’t squeeze, talk later
“That’s my baby”
What my mama say when I got her that Mercedes
Make that old woman feel like a young lady, that’s crazy
I went from broke as a yoke to no jokin homie just pay that

[Chorus: The Stylistics]
If I had money I'd go out
Buy you furs, dress you like a queen
And in a chauffeured limousine
We'd look so fine
But I'm an ordinary guy
And my pockets are empty

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
You want to know what the Midwest is?
Wild and restless where reckless niggas might snap ya necklace
And next them niggas might jack ya Lexus
Whole blocks fighting over blocks like Tetris
That’s so foolish
We finna flip the rocks and stocks on your back
Buy everybody computers
Every ride is the newest, every chick be the nudest
Doin’ it for ourselves, ya'll know how them crackers do it
So you bounce my nigga
Hands out, like we smoke an ounce my nigga
Stand by, we about to flip the game, equip the rain
Buy three houses and we decorate our cribs the same
So take that witcha
Starving artists naw man
Paint that picture
As long as I got my film
Can't get richer
Standin’ by me
Without a deal
Making this mil

[Chorus: The Stylistics]
If I had money I'd go out
Buy you furs, dress you like a queen
And in a chauffeured limousine
We'd look so fine
But I'm an ordinary guy
And my pockets are empty
If I had money I'd go out
Buy you furs, dress you like a queen
And in a chauffeured limousine
We'd look so fine
But I'm an ordinary guy
And my pockets are empty




[Intro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Some day, some day, some day
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some day, some days, I remembered this on a Sunday
Back way, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, some days, not gonna please everybody
Some days I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Some days, ohh (Heatstroke)
Now that I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked lies
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Outro: 070 Shake]
Woah, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free




[Verse 1]
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (black)
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (black)
Came to see him and his black kin (black)
My homie was number one draft pick
They still burned his jersey in Akron
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Saying he overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

[Hook]
Four in the morning, and I’m zoning
Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
Baby we livin' in the moment
Baby we livin' in the moment
Baby we livin' in the moment

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
And nowhere to go now
But there's no way to slow down
Runnin' outta time
Just put your ass and enjoy the crash

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' it
Them niggas ain't doin' it
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that’s rapping
We might have to burn this whole suit down
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
300 girls, and we know it
300 girls, and I'm zonin'
Baby, we livin' in the moment
Baby, we livin' in the moment
Baby, we know it, keep it goin'
Keep it goin', keep it goin'

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
Just [?] and enjoy the crash

[Verse 1]
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
God MC—me—Jay-Hova
Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war
R.O.C. too strong for y'all
It's like bringin' a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringin' them boys to men, how them boys gonna win?
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy
Niggas'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your drama
We kill you motherfuckin' ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to you dunny ‘cause I overdo it
So you won't confuse it with just rap music

[Hook]
R.O.C., we runnin' this rap shit

("Watch out! We run New York")

[Verse 2]
I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews
You little fuck, I got money stacks bigger than you
When I was pushin' weight back in '88
You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella students of the game, we passed the class
‘Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let 'em gas you like "Jigga is ass and won't clap you."
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
No, you're not on my level, get your brakes tweaked
I sold what your whole album sold in my first week
You guys don't want it with Hov
Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov, no!

[Verse 3]
I know you miss it Nas the (fame)
But along with celebrity comes about 70 shots to your frame
Nigga, you a (lame)
You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started, but now you're just garbage
Fell from top 10 to not mentioned at all
To your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally"'s verse better than yours
Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin' song
But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine
That's why your (lame) career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Nigga, you ain't live it, you witnessed it from your folks' pad
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor
Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was gettin' fucked then
I know who I paid, God – Serchlite publishin'
Use your (brain) – you said you've been in this 10
I've been in it five; smarten up, Nas!
Four albums in 10 years, nigga? I could divide
That's one every… let's say two, two of them shits was doo
One was "nah," the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average
And that's so (lame)
Nigga, switch up your flow, your shit is garbage
What you tryin' to kick, knowledge?
You niggas gonna learn to respect the king
Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen
Because you-know-who did you-know-what
With you-know-who, but let's keep that between me and you

[Verse 4]
A wise man told me don't argue with fools
‘Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga, I'm grown
Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
Please, not Jay, he's not for play
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yappin' be finished
You are not deep, you made your bed, now sleep
Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you
Nigga, I know you well, all the stolen jew-els
Twinkletoes, you're breakin' my heart
You can't fuck with me; go play somewhere, I'm busy
And all you other cats throwin' shots at Jigga
You only get half a bar – fuck y'all niggas!




[Intro]
I don't wanna be what you want me to be
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
It's over

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Verse 1]
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled
I don't wanna be what you want me to be (don't wanna be)
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
Oh, the clothes I bought you could still wear (still wear)
Did you store the cards and teddy bears (ooh)
See there I go again sticking my nose
I'm sorry it's my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for

It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Verse 2]
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough (strange enough)
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful, yeah (painful)
You know we used to talk about our future
It ain't just all my fault (I know, I know, I know we used to talk about it, babe)
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall (leaves would fall)
The way we stand in the rain and we would bawl (we would cry)
Just say goodbye
To the walks and talks and the dark in the park
And it ain't just all my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
We lost a four leaf clover
Don't ask why shorty be over
News flash shorty we over
We like Def Jam and Hova
We like Bobby and Whitney
Except without the kiddies
Like Pamela Anderson's career
Except without the titties
We had some good times didn't we
I know I won't forget that
But we had some bad times and
That's time I wish I could get back
We coulda had it all
But I guess we'll never know
You been around me long enough
To know that now it's over

[Hook]
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Outro]
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey




[Intro: Kanye West and Ghostface Killah]
It's your boy Ne-Yo, we gonna do it like this
The Roc is in the building, yeah
It's the remix yo
Kanye is in the building
Yo, the monster don is in the building, we in here
Kanye West is in the building
Ghostface
Your boy getting fat now
I got the fat stomach and laid up, eating good now
Other girl all stressed out, my girl got the fat ass
Shorty mad, pulling her hair out

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Verse: Kanye West]
I'm high powered, put Eva Mendes to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
But back to you, MAC gloss chick, you're way fit
How you have everything in this world and waste it
Prince told me it'll be okay, I'm so sick like Ne-Yo say
I'm laid back, like neo-soul, I holla back at this Creole ho
She from the N.O., but she never told me "N-O" so
We at the spot to chill, where the food get grilled
She ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal
Second I walked in, the whole room got still
I don't know how to put this, but I'm kind of a big deal
And she conceited, she got a reason
She got her hair did, she got her weave in
And I'mma sweat that out by the evening
You, I don't sweat that now, I got a new

[Chorus]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Oh girl, I can't believe you zoned out
Played me for this dude, nice shoes and a bottle of coast out Mont'
I'm that Don Wilson
First one to put you up six suites in that Resident Hilton
Mink coach, colorful stones and big stacks
Yeah, I was fucking, but you don't get me back like that
Causing me grief, you know me and homey had beef
Now you got me losing my mind, out up in these streets
You flamingo, showing your true colors
Heard ya'll was ducking down low when you see my brothers
But it's all good, I move from ex to next
Got the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks
Fat bubble, her body's like one of the best
But I don't need to say nothing, ask Kanye West
She eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate
And you mad cause you played yourself, it's your fault, trick

[Chorus]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Verse: Ne-Yo]
Shot through the heart, the girl caught me
Shot through the block, with him shot gun
He lucky, I ain't stop, copped the shotgun
Killah type cat, you better be glad, I'm not one
Had a couple stars up in my sky
She was my moon and my sunshine
Dude ain't even fly, he just some guy
You blamed yourself, I'm done, peace, one

[Chorus]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no




[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This the new crack, on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me, "You back!"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way, nigga, you should fucking quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you, motherfucker, and I get it, haha
No paper, ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going H·A·M, nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, why I have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn, a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been moved
I swam waters with Great Whites
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like, "Really: half a billi nigga, really?" You got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
With my nephew die, daddy's dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother, pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Comme des Garçons, fuck yo' fresh
Head shots, nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork
Peace, God, 'cause you know a nigga just went

[Hook: Jay-Z]
H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go H·A·M
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go H·A·M

[Outro]
Vivat rex in homine
Vivat rex in homine
Vivat rex in homine
Vivat rex in homine

[Verse 1: Kanye West, The-Dream & Young Thug]
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back (shit back)
I don't know (I don't know)
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro (GoPro)
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo (in slo-mo, slow motion)

Might tell a lesson and still is my mentor
Famous people act so damn pretentious huh

We don't stop, naw, we don't quit
And ya say Chi-City
We don't stop, naw, we don't quit
And ya say Chi-City
We don't stop, naw, we don't quit

[Verse 1: Common]
I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me
Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap
It ain't ninety-fo' Joe, we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'mma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-
Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black
I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city
The city, the city, the city, the city
Come on

[Hook: Scratches of Kanye West and Common]
And ya say Chi-City
We don't stop, naw, we don't quit

[Verse 2: Common]
A black figure...in the middle with chaos and gunfire
So many raps about rims, surprised niggas ain't become tires
On the street you turn cold and then go screech
I tell 'em "fuck 'em" like I do to police
The beast is runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?
I slap a nigga like you, and tell him "Rick James bitch!"
With your Hollywood stories, on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com', has never been involved wit' run
Unless it's DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip-hop is goin', it's Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city y'all, the city
Uh, the city y'all, come on

[Hook: Scratches of Kanye West and Common]
And ya say Chi-City
We don't stop, naw, we don't quit

Rap version of Spike Lee, I write thuggism
Spend a grip then throw a clip at the party
Snatch your chick and have her drippin' for Free
We're rap stars, nigga

[Hook: Cassius Henry]
This party, up in the party
Got my eye on one special shorty
This shorty's gonna be ours and
She's got eyes for me

She's got eyes for me

[Interlude: Cassius Henry]
Yo sniper, cut it
Spit it through the wire Kanye

[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Baby back it up, yeah that's it
Only thing left to ask is
Who the hottest in UK?
They holla back "You, K."
What more can I say?
If I be tourin'
Don't be borin'
Don't be actin' all righteous, you ain't Lauryn
Maybe this chain'll constitute some brain
I know you ain't no prostitute, but I'm saying

Baby I'm gone, I need a sure thing




[Intro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Yeah

Bottom line is (Ugh), you the finest
Gave you a new name
(What's that? What's that? What's) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there
Let's capture this moment (Boi, boi, boi, boi)
If I hit it then I own it, marijuan'-in' every mornin (We... on)
And Patrón-ing, girl, we groaning (Do it)
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on, on? 'Cause you know I gotta go in 'til it's

[Hook: Roscoe Dash, Big Sean, & Both]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Talk to the, talk to the... hand!
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s, like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
Rri-ih, rri-ih, rri-ih, rri-ih (There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem?
AHHHH!

[Hook: Roscoe Dash & Kanye West]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone

[Interlude: Kanye West]
I be saying, I, uh, I think
When I know, uh, just because...

[Verse 3: Kanye West, Big Sean, & Both]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half-Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on (Whoa)
You should just go and throw a cape on (Whoa)
And it’s just so amazing
So amazing, so amazing
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
Westside is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne-tasting
Ain't no rush, girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Hook: Roscoe Dash & Big Sean]
Early in the morning (Yeah)
When she’s all alone (When she's all...)
I’ma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl (Mood!)
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
(And I'ma give it to ya) The long way
(And give it to ya) The strong way
(We at it all day) It’s our day
(It's like this always) It’s our way (After a long day)

[Intro: James Fauntleroy & Big Sean]
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, ‘cause I want some
B-I-G, who fuckin' with me?
Oh, God! Whoa, okay

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the-, they want the-, they want the-

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
(B-I-G, oh, God! Go)
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me, like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, she tryin' to get me that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin' with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin' villain
Man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
That's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
(Click clack, stick 'em up!)
Yeah, I'm talkin' Ye, yeah, I'm talkin' Rih
Yeah, I'm talkin' B, nigga, I'm talkin' me
Yeah, I'm talkin' bossy, I ain't talkin' Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talkin' LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, 'least that what my neck say
'Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told—who he gonna tell?
We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green, it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin' with the clique

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Outro: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the
Go!




[Intro]
And it'll be a long time, before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 1]
They want me, hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vein
Couple [?] of the feds say I'm insane
A psych said I'm going [?]
And then his son told me put down the drink dawg
I got a [?]
I guess [?] finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks

And every, god needs a goddess
And every, star couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I [?] with my riders
[?] with my Riders
[?]

[Hook]
And I don't like them, and they don't like that
They don't like that, and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hating motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 2]
See I need some time to meditate
Naw bitch I'm fly I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try, tryna' hesitate
[?] nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight and I'm very great
I put the everyday rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must've on faith, getting knocked of faith
Guess it's not faith, guess it was written
I can sell a phone, guess I was different
That was cellphone back then, that was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound like
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic
I don't even have a knife
Feel like [?]
And these niggas are secondary like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light
I'mma be downright, you niggas is downright biters
And I'mma [?] fighters
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh

[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout you and maybe I do
[?]
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something not we can do
[?] me
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, na na na na
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
Before you ever see me again, me again, again, again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

[Bridge]
Can you clap your hands, hands
Clap your, clap your hand, hands
Clap your, clap your hand, hands
And I wanna something, I wanna something then
Can you clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand

[Verse 3]
So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like the collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday with the [?]
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit don't pan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
[?] on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two more shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm "that nigga"
Or maybe if [?] is not a cellphone [?]
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit [?]
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should [?] I could reconsider
[?] cellphone liver
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no liver
I can stand and deliver 'til the [?]
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, gonna die by the [?]
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud [?]
And I could style on [?], hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm [?]
I'm liable to be a liability [?]
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like [?]
[?]

[Hook 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
When the fuck I'm going hard, nigga fuck you

Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing

Get a better tan and

And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And n afternoon I annex

Stunting on the sun, cus I have to ball
I run the world cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all

And you feeling like you got it all?

[Hook]
Worry 'bout me, don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'chya gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]

Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense [?] what y'all 'bout?
Bumping [?]something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, you don't fuck around
Put everything on the [?] something then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, [?] a specialist
I was under [?] and learning what the lessons is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the sedatives
[?] and you had to look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
[?]
[?] put hands on you, then put his front side and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I can [?] the world

[Hook]
Worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can [?] when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again




[Verse 1]
She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla, so she love them
Looked at the jury, how can they judge him, she screamed

[Chorus]
(Before you lock my love away) Put your hands in the air
(Before you lock my love away) Yeah, you say
(Before you lock my love away) Yeah, it go
(Before you lock my love away)
(Please let me testify)

[Verse 2]
Fear in her chest her face in tears
Had her man's back he was facing years
In her name, though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through stumbling fights
He tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried, she bubbled inside and screamed

[Chorus]
(Before you lock my love away) Put your hands up
(Before you lock my love away) Keep your hands up
(Before you lock my love away) And the people say
(Before you lock my love away)
(Please let me testify)

[Verse 3]
The judge yelled for order
Court reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confessions, she screamed

[Chorus]
(Before you lock my love away) Everybody say
(Before you lock my love away) Put your hands up
(Before you lock my love away) Sing it with us y'all
(Before you lock my love away)
(Please let me testify)

[Verse 4]
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts, tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

[Chorus]
(Before you lock my love away) Everybody say
(Before you lock my love away) Put your hands up
(Before you lock my love away) All the ladies say
(Before you lock my love away)

Guilty...next case

They treat you rough out there
But we've got Alcantara everywhere
Ferrari

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're so familiar
White Ferrari
Good times
I care for you still
And I will
Forever
That was my part of the deal
Honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari
Good times

(In this life)
You love me still and you will forever
You got that part of the deal
We got so familiar
Running my hands thru your hair
White Ferrari
Had a good time
(in this life)

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids
On a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'll drop you off and in a few months
We'll talk again
When you need a break
Which part of the circle will you stand on
You keep doing the dance wrong

I'm sure we're taller in other dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving
Your body's aching
We should vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull
Least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

Like a mirage
Always one step ahead
Where we belong
I've got a son somewhere
He'll be picking up where I left off
I might name that boy Ferrari
He'll meet a girl named Altashonda
He'll treat her soft like Alcantara
My brain is soft like Alcantara
My hands are rough, I'm iguana
Your hair is long, are you Nicaraguan?
I can't go soft, I'm Viagran
You want it all
You're always one step ahead
Where you belong

[Verse 1]
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
We keepin' it gangster, say "fo' shizzle", "fo' sheezy", and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
Yo, our activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
All types of drug, when all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[Outro]
Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready—ready for action—action

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Outro]
God! God! God! God!
God! God! God! God!
God! God! God!

Now tell me that ain't insecurrr. The concept of school seems so securrr. Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr. She like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of airs cause her baby daddy dont really care. Shes so precious with the peer pressure,couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexus. She had hair so long that it looked like weave then she cut it all off now she look like eve. And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe single black female addicted to retail.and well

Chorus:

Then i spent 400 bucks on this just to be like nigga you ain't up on this. And i can't even go to the grocery store without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team it seems we living the american dream. But people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things for the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us,floss cause they degrade us,we trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper look how low we'll stoop even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe

Chorus:
Kanye West:
