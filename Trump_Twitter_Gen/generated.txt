The Democrats Plot to Untangle the Trump Network Email Leaks is now in the Democrat General‚Äôs Daily, the final version of the BIG LEAK, before it is too late. It is being investigated with a vengeance. @JeffJlpa1 is a sleazy face who deserves to be DRAINED!
Stephen Miller, New York Times, should spend more time reading his very interesting and well written book, ‚ÄúPhony Trump Haters,‚Äù rather than constant relitigating the Trump 20-something career. I never apologized. All I did is Make America Great Again!
Remember, @CNN is cheap and biased against me. Very bad for U.S.
Education of children in America is absolutely critical. We must ensure that all have access to the critical basics necessary for human development. We must ensure that all have the opportunity to reach their full potential. #HRBillRequiresAdoption

Democrats just blocked @NASA from taking humans to the Moon by a vote of 78-13. Republicans should get rid of the terrible and unnecessary restrictions. Get there soon, Democrats will come for you!
The Fake News Networks and individuals are working overtime to make certain their viewers, friends and even neighbors are not happy. They ‚ÄúHATE,‚Äùdisgusting and ungrateful, but I get their business!
#SenSchumer hearing debunker myth once again! He did not say that CR is necessary, only that Republicans must SMARTLY WIN IN JUDGEMENT OF OUR COUNTRY BEFORE IT IS HELD. NICE!
The only thing that crooked Hillary Clinton has going for her is her endless supply of lies. She is not qualified!
A wonderful article by Jeff Zeleny of the Failing New York Times - A Romney replacement would be bad for America.
Just heard that Oil could be coming from Persia at a record pace. Their are few oil problems in world today. I agree!

Wonderful Mexico and a deal yet to be made which will greatly help America. I am getting it done!
Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right now in Washington, D.C. He will be a great LEAP voter and friend. #VoteTrumpTogether!
The 2nd A.G. did not want me talking about the 3rd A.G. at the Border, fearing that would get me into BIG trouble!

Apple announced a radical new tax strategy today that will dramatically expand the reach & reach of its employees. We applaud CNET & Apple's bold move.
Just got word that we will have used Scam and Tongue in our very long awaited, & controversial, Trade Deal with China. This is a one time only deal ‚Äì nothing else!
Hillary Clinton won Florida all* covered by Trump + Obama:
Today we celebrate the incredible accomplishments of Americans with ASD/HD. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with America in their quest for universal accessibility and lifelong success.
One of my FIRST acts as President will be to liberate Saudi Arabia and the money draining blockade will finally be lifted. üá∫üá∏üáÆüá∞üá∑
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater economic and job destruction. Do NOT support this terrible deal!
Roth Puff, CEO of the C.H.R., was my inaugural Volunteer of the Year. Imagine how effective her agency was when she was a V.P. candidate. @realDonaldTrump will be even better V.P., thank you, really big help!
Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in Congress in many years. Look at his record!
As Obama said, Cyber is real, and very Connected, and somebody had to take it out. I wonder if they would have prosecuted Crooked Hillary, with the help Iran, Russia, the Black Panther Party and others?
Totally false reporting on my call with the Ukrainian President. It was very somber and intellectual, both for the press and the people, other than the Failing New York Times, which I constantly corrected. It is hard to believe that another reporter would do such a story!
Jealous of another woman who championed ‚Äî & endorsed me for president, Crooked Hillary, who made a fortune off of selling bad (racist) ads, lost easily. But couldn‚Äôt make the debate, mocked!

The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to sell the massive Crowdfunding success of my Presidency. Actually, they are barely reporting the events of the past 7 days. The good news is that the Federal Reserve is weakening so hard that taxes and inflation will be going down as our economy grows. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Fed is doing what‚Äôs called in the business the easy way.‚Äù @GrahamLedger @MariaBartiromo
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich are weak at the border. They can never pass the real Immigration Reform. No hands on the wall? We have the votes but it won‚Äôt happen!
These 9 great people will have a huge impact on our country. The voters turned down the big money candidates, but will now easily be turned out (WHAT?).Big wins by¬†Crooked Hillary Clinton and DEMS IN CONGRESS!
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today about the horrible attack in Mirf resupply in CA. He is disturbed by the terrible terrorist who just struck. We stand by our incredible people!

‚ÄúTrump Administration Assistants Use of Twitter to Mislead on Iran‚Äù @foxandfriends  If the Pres were tweeting to millions of people, the network would be ‚Äònuclear.‚Äù I wonder if they would be taking the massive hit now that they were stopped in their tracks. But it never happened!

We can end the crippling $14 billion yearly nuclear winter embargo on Turkey at no cost to the United States. In fact, the Bills to that effect already have my total full endorsement!
A country must stop discriminating against its citizens on the basis of gender. If countries are admitting too many women & giving preference to women over men in certain jobs, it is time for a change!

When your making a deal with Iran take into account the fact they are going to renege on the deal if it is not approved.
Bad deal with Iran, or lack of deal, is a deal of no return!

I am the BEST builder, just look at what I've built - lots of new projects with my total focus. New competitor, Trump, doesn‚Äôt have a clue!
The @WSJ story as to why China and Europe are rebelling is inaccurate, they are only showing the good results from the past 8 years, not the current 8 years!
We finally have a truth. What was the purpose of the so-called Whistleblower, a fake writer or messenger, leaking to @nytimes and others? Also, why aren‚Äôt the Committees and investigators, almost totally uninterested in Trump and Russia, looking into the crooked Mueller Witch Hunt (Spirit of 9/11)!
I have asked Steve to share with Congress the highly classified information the Department of Justice and FBI are desperately trying to protect so badly. This is so important that it should be disclosed. If not, the people will soon find out!
IN HIS OWN WORDS? TRUMP: We‚Äôre not in a trade war with China, that‚Äôs a false story. We have a trade deficit of almost 3 Trillion Dollars with China.  @LouDobbs   Do you notice we are not having a large trade meeting today? THIS IS CHANGING OUR STRATEGY.

Tremendous success today with Cisco's live Webcast of the White House Switching from the AN/PRC, to the Wireless for National Security. Telstra would have been first competitor, but was a great partner. Very impressed with Chairman Kim!
The real story that the FBI and DOJ can ill afford is the one about the FBI‚Äôs rigging of the entire Russia probe, and for that reason they have said publicly they will take the Fifth. Australian law enforcement has already come to the defense of the FBI!
Great time on @cathymcmorgan's wonderful @marklevinshow on @FoxNews!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Many NATO countries, and now the United States, spent vast sums of money on their equipment, labor, and really any expenses related to the continual fight against ISIS. For the next decade or so, U.S. spent very little. NATO countries greatly increased spending!
The legendary Roger Pensock was just quoted as saying that "winning the White House is bigger than politics." That is true, and politics can only be changed!

So General Flynn lies to the FBI and he is still employed by the Department of Defense. Tell that to the Department of Defense. His wife, as they found out, is a felon!
Just got the very nice note from China informing me that their Banks are not as big or as strong as they used to be. Cheaper to the consumer, safer to the Bank. Mainland China is experiencing a lot of ‚Äúmerit points,‚Äù probably the highest you‚Äôve ever seen. No more vicious trade war with the U.S. Mainland China puts the Bank‚Äôs new ‚ÄúTechnology, Innovation, and Practice Accelerator Program in competition for the first time.‚Äù This will make things better for everybody, including our Country!
‚ÄúBarrett- we‚Äôre doing everything we can to help our counterpart, the Venezuelan people, while at the same time helping the U.S.A. We have offered assistance in the form of $35 million over the next 9 months, going primarily to the GOOD People of Venezuela.‚Äù ‚Äî @SenateBipartisan Bill

If Iran cheats, we open the Strait of Hormuz and Camp David. If they don‚Äôt, we invite in the Navy. If they cheat, we fight a big South African Arms race. Dumb!
Ben Carson says "deplorables" when talking about Trump supporters. Please explain to Ben that "deplorables" was a big & happy group.
The people of Iran did a great job in electing Rouhani president. The worst thing in the world for him (and me) is what the U.S. might do with the Statue of Liberty!

John Kasich is at it again. Just got caught.He's lost his way, too negative.Too bad!
Thank you Wayne Root.
The U.S. has an increased economic value of nearly 7,000 Trillion Dollars since the Tax Cut Bill went into effect, and did I mention, we have one of the best economies in the World. Did I mention we have the LOWEST unemployment numbers EVER, the strongest economy ever, incredible consumer spending & JOBS! A $$$ return!
About 500,000 x 10,000 Jobs, down 4,000 in one year! I will bring back full employment. Obamacare dead!
Bill Kristol just said that Donald Trump ‚Äúlooked more like a woman to me.‚Äù This statement from a great and honest guy. Almost made up by the losers and losers!
Well, every interview that  has been given to date has negatively impacted me.I made a lot of money and am in the White House waiting for the interviewers to ask me a question.They don‚Äôt want to hear my answer on Charlottesville, or on the Radical Islamic Terror that is going on in Europe (which I said "we will defeat").

Obama's deal with Iran will only deepen our nation‚Äôs terrible humanitarian crisis. I can‚Äôt imagine that any other President could have done it.

Biden is a tough guy, but the Great State of Minnesota, which I love, did the right thing and picked Labash Leader, a man I truly respect. He will help rebuild our Military, which is desperately needed, and much else!
Jim Mattis, our Nation‚Äôs top war hero, was honorably discharged from the Navy after 9 years of service. A great guy, I helped him get back onto the small (but growing) small screen. He gets more screen time than any other HERO. Jim has a great team of folks that love his record!

The yearly budget of ISIS, by far the most powerful and dangerous of all the terrorists, is only $12,575,000, for a total of $19,022,844,000. Budget is not balanced. Our country does not have the ‚ÄúW‚Äù to protect itself from some of the most dangerous people on earth! Budget is getting worse, not better!

They are spreading lies by saying that low ratings @CNN isn't good enough. I like Lester too much to watch.

I proposed a temporary ban on immigration from seven countries, all derived from the fact that they are Country Y The Old Country, Syria. The media claimed otherwise. Now, President Obama agrees. I will be making a temporary ban during my term in office. It will apply retroactively to Visa Waiver program!
When drilling for oil, sometimes a Super Scoop works better than a traditional well. Sometimes there is no Super Scoop and we will have to rely on our existing processes, or we will have to start going to the next page. So, if there is no Super Scoop, just readjust your well (or next well). Rick Vitter is 100% correct!

You can't compare anything to ObamaCare on some level, and especially the unpopular & highly flawed Republican attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act. Don't let the Democrats tell you they had it easy.It didn‚Äôt work out so well - it is time to get smart & solve problems!
Troy Balderson absolutely destroyed Congressman Jim Jordan. With Trent, Criminal Justice will work better than ever before! NO COLLUSION!
Great dedication and work ethic! @OANN @foxandfriends
Heading over to Trump National Doral, Miami ‚Äî look forward to seeing our GREAT TEAMS!
Thanks Lou.
The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet Republican Senators are obstructing the goal of getting them approved. Stupid!
Union and Democrats are trying to repeal and replace the horrible disaster known as #Obamacare. It is dead - we have horrible high prices & no help from Nancy Pelosi!
I hope the serious reverend gentleman from California, who took a VERY dim and phony picture of me (a far better quality than the amateur), keeps his failing paper (California). TURN IT IN!
Just got back from the great people of South Carolina yesterday. #VoteTrump
Stephen Miller, who led the charge for Trump, is out at the FBI as a very big problem. He was the one who should have fired Comey, by my reckoning, regardless of the fact that he had recused himself. He was chasing a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù deal at Justice. This is a total conflict of interest. I take it into the General Election!
Thank you! #MAGAüá∫üá∏

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
The question I am asked the most is, "Why are you using social media then, #FakeNewsCNN, #NBCNews, @SamuelLJackson, who knows nothing about me, shows pictures of my foreign bedbugs?"  Thank you, @SamuelLJackson.
Great interview tonight Chuck Todd on @MeetthePress with @chucktodd at @NBC this afternoon.
I had a great time in Iowa today! I am now at a rally in Des Moines, IA. See you soon Iowa!
Democrats don‚Äôt want money from Border Security Funds - but won‚Äôt give us the votes necessary. Don‚Äôt worry, we have the votes. We need more Republican votes.
Why is a failure in judgement by @JudgeJeanine on a case that I was involved in making possible for people with disabilities  so bad. Maybe I was, but I never was!
Don‚Äôt ever forget! #MAGAüá∫üá∏
Great @Cabinet meeting at the @WhiteHouse today!
‚ÄúIt is the Democrats doing the 'take what they can get'‚Äù by making the decision between you and the Republican Party. This is their freedom day!
China put out a FAKE NEWS book claiming I wanted to trade with them. This is a phony story by @CNN and others. I wanted to meet with President Xi!
We should never have let the poorly treated and vicious of lead the mainstream media into believing that the Democrats, with the very destructive mission of having our Country stolen by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, would approve legislation to RAISE taxes substantially. These are Democrat dreams!
Don't like  the look of the new estashingtonpost-it is old, boring and has no employees. Need people who can work in WALL!
Thank you @CongresswomanMorgan!
Great job by FEMA, Law Enforcement and all. Our "Gang of Eight" working so well!
Join me today in Cleveland, Ohio!
Media failed so badly on the so-called Collusion |collusion oath. A terrible instrument indeed! They conspired to keep the badly required report, and made it so embarrassing & illegal. Not a good sound bite, but true! Others are coming to power, but they know nothing about the Russian Collusion.
Wow, REALLY bad news! The best job shooting ever took place in Orlando. Just killed 49 people and 12 others were wounded. No understanding of gun culture-& mental illness!
So pathetic!

Hillary Clinton lost the election only in a historic Electoral College victory. We shouldn't stop working to win elections. #Day8
Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, will be running for Congress from California, so important as representing California, and has my complete and total Endorsement, she should easily win. She is strong on crime and illegal immigration, will make Border sure, protect Second Amendment, and has my full and complete Endorsement!
Establishment Republicans, in the form of Karl Rove and his group, are now working hard (and late) to make the Republican win in November hard to come back!
Boy did Hillary Clinton give away that secret e-mail server, she deleted 33,000 emails AFTER getting a demand letter from United States Congress. Gave away by the Democrats, now our Tax Returns will be made public - confusion!
‚ÄúTrump Standard-Lowest Bid in Historic Presidential Race‚Äù  @WSJarticle  If I‚Äôm elected President I am going to Tax & Regulation kills any business, start making goods in the U.S., & bring jobs back home. I want to make our economy Great Again!
As President, I WILL fix this rigged system and only answer to YOU, the American people!
Great news is being made & celebrating in Israel right now. Congratulations to @CES2017!
Getting ready to leave for Louisville, Kentucky, to vote for @HillaryClinton for president & then Tampa, Florida, for a big rally with energy from both!
Military is far more powerful and far more expensive than we thought. Joint Strike Fighters, which costs $4.7 Billion/year (up from $3.6 BILLION last year), will cost $20 BILLION (2%) for the first time.They have become obsolete in the Air War. Our friends and enemies will pay much more. Sorry Boeing and Lockheed Martin, you will lose lots of money!
Some Members of Congress may not like the results of the Mueller Report finding, but they shouldn‚Äôt try to overturn it. The word was never there, the letter doesn‚Äôt matter. The Witch Hunt must be on a newscast!
Most Republicans support the two soldiers and other family members of Sgt. La David Johnson, including a recent poll, by a whopping 53% to 25%. That's a lot of Democrats and Amnesty Joe, who are 0 for Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I will always vote with the American People!
Catch and Release has failed so many people. Without it our country would be practically deserted. Clinton wants gun violence to get even higher. Vote Trump.
I am going to give the A.P. a brand new, beautifully remodeled headquarters soon!
Heading back to Washington after working hard and watching some of the worst and most dishonest Fake News reporting I have ever seen!
Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's horrible speech. He is not happy, not surprised, that Crooked Hillary is doing such a bad job.
If @Macys shares my opinion, which I fully endorse, ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù then they should fire all of their 400 workers. I campaigned on making America great again!

Great news out of New York City today, as they celebrate the opening of their new Trump Tower. Congratulations to both the Trump and Borgholz families, thank you to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Even a trillion dollars of unnecessary spending by the Democrats, mostly in the form of cuts & beautification, has hurt us badly on the Border. Unless they make a deal with me, it will be the start of the end. Democrats are all talk!

Twitter must allow the removal of several billion people from the U.S., at some time in the future, via proper system. Our country is drowning in people that cannot use our welfare system & I will fix!

Fight hard and take back the White House! #DrainTheSwamp
When the Democrats in charge of Congress don‚Äôt give us the votes needed to stop Criminal Immigration, we are forced to start the old fashioned WAY BACK! It is called Natural Born Citizenship. They got it wrong, in other words, PERIOD. We want it fixed now!
The Democrat Governor @Mike_Pence is in poor health - thoughts and prayers for him. Nobody understands him better than me!
Why should I be defending a fraudulent Witch Hunt? It was started by people who should be defending the ‚ÄúInformation Age.‚Äù It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary, which is illegal. There was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the lying, corrupt FBI, Justice Department & Russia). Did I mention her illegally deleted 33,000 Emails?
Heading over to one of our GREAT @PoliceDept unions for a news conference later this afternoon.
Congratulations David!
So they totally ruined the Trump rally by bringing in Sidney @Kingwood69. Ridiculous!

Nancy (I hope you're enjoying your time with Ben Carson) Schiff deserves a Nobel Prize for his work on making sure the true story of the phone call is never told. An embarrassment to our Country!
After 2 big wins since the Election I wonder if the Democrats will give me the resources to get even what I really want: the complete repeal and replace of ObamaCare? I have a great decision to make!
For the great people of Nebraska, a record number of applications this year, and the first time in almost half a century. #VoteTrump
Thanks Bill, a big one!
Others are criticising but I can vouch for the fact that, after two catastrophic votes, my approval numbers are at 50% with  American people! So far, one negative and two new polls, but can end in a majority!
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
Looks like Bernie Sanders fans will show up to protest the real loss candidates (i.e., Crooked Hillary) will engender. Want the nomination ASAP!

The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is losing  money at CNN and is in big trouble. Very sad!
After around two weeks of paying very little (and doing nothing), the Dems are doing not only a BAD & INDOCTRINABLE job but having their act together. Billions of Dollars, not a single silver lining. His Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was NOT responsible for the breach. CHARISMA A PROBLEM!
I want to congratulate Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will serve in that capacity for a very long time with great energy and understanding. This is a man who truly gets the job done! #StateDept

So where do we sit right now? We have entered the most powerful ever Administration in history. No excuses for what has happened. Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page, son & all others. Totally corrupt. Witch Hunt!
Why are Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer, upset that the budget deal was not approved by Congress during the election? Think they were nobodies before the Election. House Republicans will not let them get away with this type of thing!
The decades long bias of the @nytimes in favor of covering the Clintons‚Äô corrupt agenda is totally amazing. Also, the fact that they never quote or use any evidence on Trump. We alone can save the Dems!
I wonder now that President Obama has spent so much time with me and done so little. He has done so little for us. I will bring jobs back and make our country rich again!
How do you fight a DISGRACE while addressing the millions of people that are so sad. The rally was very successful and audience was fantastic. The bad news, an estimated 800,000 people in Texas. Pulled off the biggest ever fireworks display in USA history!

Watching Colin Powell's speech on Iraq now. This is a great man, very intelligent, and shows how dumb politicians are always trying to make him sound smart. The problem is that Powell is 1% and every other politician is 100% Chokers!

I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine - not everyone agrees. As I stated at the request of both parties, Vets should not be detained.

Big wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, the news that is Fake News, and Iowa unfortunately, but they are not what the Democrats want, they want chaos and division. That‚Äôs what they seem to be trying to achieve with the Democrats in charge in Gravis County, North Carolina. I give them both!
Mark Warner got hit (very hard) yesterday over at the FBI, and this is just another bad news story after the terrible James Comey leak and later, the Inspector General‚Äôs report on Clinton. Nevertheless, the investigation is a farce, and much of it is corrupt. Comey got MUCH LESS HANDED!

The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The European Union and the United States are working very hard to give them what they want. The people have no choice!

The Failing New York Times did not say that James Comey told me (along with his friend Peter S, the head of the FBI), that he was under investigation. He, along with many others, could have told me that. I said NO. Where was the FBI Director, and where was the Attorney General?
ALABAMA just voted overwhelmingly to impeach the Bush, Rubio & Cruz rep. Really big shift!

The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Adam Schiff, should read the Transcript of the Phone Call (Audio) with Ukraine (Thanks Lamar), a very bad and painful call for the sake of brevity, but which Rep.

So sad that the FBI wants to admit back into the game into the Clinton Campaign, even though the maturing process has left the FBI confident in knowledge of its illegal & highly surveilled activities.
More and more, law enforcement is showing up at our Southern Border looking for trouble. These are very sad times for our Country!
The prevailing winds in the Great State of Florida last night were at 50 or 51 mph with gusts to excess 50 mph. Atlanta could be hit, just like yesterday. 50 in Boston. Thin skinned Murphy would NEVER let this happen. Very weak, naive and only works on Republicans. Edward Snowden is traitors for walking!
Can you imagine O'Malley, who has gone absolutely nowhere with his run for governor, as governor of Maryland? He had no chance. Trump won the race big!
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. What was this Griffin for? A cheap photo op? No decency sign here!

I have requested, and the Department of Justice is providing, a thorough investigation of the Russian Witch Hunt. It is a Democrat witch hunt, a disgusting and corrupt scandal. Jeff Sessions has taken it upon himself to find out why his friend, Hillary Clinton, deleted and acid washed 33,000 Emails with the intention of destruction. This is not how we run our country!
Today, it was my great honor to welcome President @AlsisiOfficial of the Arab Republic of Egypt to the WH. We will work together to further strengthen our ties with Egypt and to ensure they are there for future engagements. Good things will happen!
Great to be in Amsterdam, it was a great day!

How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when the total loser, the President of the United States (by far), is staying silent and does nothing wrong? Why is he silent?  Should be looking at Federal investigators and the new found Marriages, some bad (or very bad), that have taken place. The people know it was a phony big hit job!
Under my Administration, Brown Coal, the largest in the United States, would have a Happy Ending. Under your Presidency, your beloved coal, the table light would have turned off, and we would now have the biggest economy in the history of our Country.

Our free illegal immigration meetings are going well and quickly in Mexico. NBC report is a complete fabrication. No meeting with Mr. Trump. Usually a handshake, but usually not!
Tremendous unemployment numbers, with an even bigger threat of losing control of our unfortunate, dysfunctional & dangerous Republicans in Congress. We have been doing this for years. Sad to watch!
How do we know they (Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi) didn‚Äôt tamper with the results of the election? They intentionally took it for granted in order to suppress the vote.

Ill be honest.
Carlos Barria, who has been nothing but friendly to me, just stated that my deal with Trump would bring jobs to the U.S. In fact, he said, most jobs would go to Mexico (so false). Maybe this is good for the U.S. After all, Mexico makes $15,000,000 from us each year, almost $20,000,000 from the U.S. Vice-President takes home another $13,000,000!
New @CNN  Poll just out - Trump 33 points up 1 point from last poll..leading 4 points behind Cruz..
Question is, who is going to fix the problems that all talk and no action will solve. Problems will inevitably crop up, some serious!
Just got an update on repairs being done to Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave. COMPLETE MAINTENANCE, and more!
And by the way, if the Democrats don‚Äôt give us the votes needed, NO MORE budget deal, then we have 12 Bills to thank you for. Too bad, because we have been treated badly by the Democrats in the past. Homeland Security, Border, Military, Vets, 2nd A. Go for it, be tough.
Can you believe it ‚Äì Bill Clinton, one of the most prominent and successful women in American Politics, was on @foxandfriends saying how bad ObamaCare is & that she liked Clinton‚Äôs healthcare plan. Bad food for thought!
Trump is making America great again. Illegal immigration is coming down 40 percent now. AZ, HI, NC and more. Much bigger results than even historic CR
DACA will be making a major return in September. It's time to end the terrible Drug Trials Barrier, and Secure the border, so we can, together with Mexico, move people safely and effectively.

There are no more Radical Republicans in Congress than those that supported the failed, & much hated, Fast Train.

Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia about their full and complete cooperation on counterterrorism operations in the Middle East. They know I back Saudi Arabia 100% - a perfect relationship. Big progress being made!
Funny how politically correct degenerates can complain about "dead words" and still be racist when someone raps on their record, ugly!
So great to see!
Nikki Haley just stated that she wants the radical left to leave the United States, no longer being a threat to our Country, if that makes any sense!
Democrats don‚Äôt want money from stopping Sanctuary Cities so they are going to take it from me. They got it from the Koch Brothers. Sanctuary cities make crime big." Crime will be coming ‚Äúfaster‚Äù than ever before!
The great people of NH are used to the dishonest media coverage of them on FOX. @FoxNews is a total joke!
Entrepreneurs: A winner takes the lead. He or she knows the path, the wind, the people, and the money. Great for momentum, great for business!
ObamaCare is ripping the economy apart and thousands of good people are losing their jobs. Good thing-came out today like never before!
How come the failing @WSJ, the respected Federal Reserve, and the failing @CNN are sending so much bad information to the public when they know there is no such thing as the New York Times or Washington Post!
Sadly, in Boston, 4 innocent people were senselessly killed. We must get tough!
Before Nancy came along and accepted billions from oligarchs in countries around the world, it was MANY other people who spoke out who got shafted, along with the people that backed her. The Fake News is working overtime!
Congratulations to my friend, The National, for having me on as their long-awaited debate winner. You will hear many things, I hear you. See you later tonight.
Thank you!üá∫üá∏üá∞üá∑üá¨
The media regularly and inaccurately reports on the size, will be the largest explosion in the history of the world! Thank you to our previous administration for keeping us in business. Big one!
Children must not grow up in a world without fathers. Too dangerous. Pablo Torrealba brings home the bacon, and @FLOTUS Melania loves French Fries. #fathersonvalues
I'm not in the White House, that‚Äôs for the Fake News Media!
Who paid for the small organized rallies by the DNC last night? Why not use DNC servers? Why not give server to the FBI? Why is the server given to the media (H/T @JesseBWatters)?
Great job by @DennisRodman and @MikePerkins! Watch over these streets ‚Äì Dennis and Mike will be here soon!

ON THE RECORD, BAD BREXIT NEWS!
#CrookedHillary and the DNC outrageously did not receive the Dem primary vote tally, very bad!
Bernie Sanders has gone big all over the country, and with good reason. He leaves next week with a powerful new movement!

Just made a speech to the incredible people of South Carolina. It was an honor to do so, with the incredible woman who started it all, @SarahUmpson. #SCPrimary
My statement on NATO being obsolete (it is obsolete), bad deal (we make the deal with Iran, they make the deal with us), and ineffective (can't solve conflicts on my watch), has been widely misinterpreted. In fact, it was intended to be more exact (perhaps we could make it perfect). While the media makes so many mistakes, this is not a campaign or Presidential election!
Just told his wife, Melania, that the FBI [Joint Terrorism Task Force] picked up "incidental collection" of Trump & Russians. Very peculiar!
Heading to St. Louis today where my son, Don, is at the Army-Navy game. Looking forward to seeing both teams!
Democrats, don't let up. Defund Trump now. Don't let up!
In addition to their being wrong about me, the CBO also says that ObamaCare will explode (I love the sound of that).Just like Demented Harry Truman, I wonder if Hillary will be able to carry out her promis‚Ä¶
A total waste of time and energy! Building up our country as fast as possible before the year is out!
‚ÄúPeople get what the hell is going on!‚Äù Kenny Howard, @foxandfriends  @LouDobbs  Very professional of a man like benjy to take the high road. @FoxNews should issue a PN amending notice for this!

It was my great honor to announce the West Point Cadets Day Honors. Tomorrow, the @WhiteHouse hosts a Briefing on the results of the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year. Congratulations Cadets!
The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their ‚ÄúPockets.‚Äù The people have little food, ISIL controls large parts of the country and money is not the answer!
Like her or not, Hillary will always be associated with corruption!
Another terrorist attack in Paris.Ban the weapons immediately. Look at the terrible attack that took place in California last week.
Funny how dopey Hugh Graham can go on CNN and still be able to  make up sources all connected with Hillary - but I will let them off the hook!
Wow, Hillary bought & retained Debbie Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs computer servers? That is really shady. Her camp setting up her totally dumb support staff. Debbie is controlled by the oligarchy - weak & powerless!
Big crowd expected in Denver tonight. Jobs and enthusiasm are amazing. Exciting politics!
Following our historic election win in November, it's @FLOTUS Melania's great honor to welcome local and state leaders, ambassadors, and citizens of the United States. #UNGA
Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term fake News CNN. LA, PLEASE SIGN THIS MOVE!

I strongly endorse Matt Rosendale for Senate. He has done a fantastic job representing the people of the Great State of Minnesota. He has my complete and total Endorsement! #MAGAüá∫üá∏
This will be a very interesting day for HealthCare. In the meantime, the Democrats who are now blocking the Tax Cuts are hurting our great Social Program. March 20th is getting close!
Slowly but surely Iran is beating the drum for Sanctions to the tune of $150 billion. Congress must act NOW!  Stop the outrage
Doing Live From Bedminster this afternoon. Great numbers on 4. Using @CBSNews Poll @TWITShortridge - we are the #1 party in NH behind only #2, NH Drudge. Shortridge is tough on Trump!

15,326 JOBS in Tax Cut and Reform by end of year, double the amount of previous administration. Also means two million plus jobs!
Who was it that secretly (but really) agreed that the topics of the joint statement and the conversation in Trump Tower were, in fact, ‚ÄúTHE TWO DEMOCRATS?‚Äù The President of the Ukraine, Aleksandr Trifkovic, has said categorically that he has no knowledge of the call. Even the President of the U.S.A., Donald J. Trump, has no knowledge of the call. Witch Hunt!
‚ÄúOn average, the new African American unemployment rate is 1.8%. White unemployment rate rises to 4.1%. Black unemployment rate goes negative.‚Äù Anthony Zurcher, The Federalist. @foxandfriends @akron12 joined me on Tuesday. Great show, fantastic people!

Why doesn't the Fake News Media state that the Trump administration has won seven out of the last eight elections despite all of the Fake & Corrupt News. SAD!

Don‚Äôt ever forget - this election is about YOU! If you are unable to VOTE, DISABLE, OR SUPPORT TRUMP in November, you are not eligible to participate.
The voters are irrationally rejecting Crooked Hillary Clinton, and the coronation of their favorite, DONALD TRUMP, is happening! Just like her emails, crooking Clinton is totally exposed!
Thank you to federal judge  J. Tom Covington for your strong & unanimous decision in favor of our Soldiers & veterans. On behalf of the U.S.A., Judge. We will now begin the long and important process of reuniting these wonderful families.
President Obama thinks the world of long term unemployed Victor Davis Hanson, author of the highly inaccurate book, ‚ÄúUnskilledImmigrants.‚Äù Also don‚Äôt listen to dopey @KarlRove, he has been wrong for 25 years. Thank you Victor!
If the people of our great Country cannot fix the very poor, very dumb and very dangerous handling of the DACA situation, they should just get smart! Let Congress do its job.
According to the @nypost, Donald Trump will be interviewed tonight by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxNews ‚Äî tomorrow morning!
Many NATO countries have decided they no longer contribute to the alliance, or to the International Troops, after many years of helping to financially support it. There are now many countries who are not in the alliance, or have agreed to withdraw their troops, very soon!
The real story under investigation is the Fake News Networks, the Networks that are most affected by the many people that are losing great money on illegal & treasonous material. Russian Collusion is being investigated, one way or the other. The Mainstream Media is silent!

25,000 amazing people yesterday in Colorado! Thank you, I love you!
Watched last night (time permitting)      on CNN. Result was a lot different than thought. Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse. Trump won MAGA!
You made @BillKristol look like a lightweight paperweight. More lightweight than Cruz!
Until the Radical Liberal Democrat Witch Hunt Hoax is over, keep talking, Brian Kemp!
I am on @CNN crew now! Just arrived in Arkansas! #Trump2016 #VoteTrump
‚ÄúThe Democrats expressly told the FBI that they had NO Dossier, ‚ÄòWhistleblower, nor any other evidence, tying Trump‚Äôs D.C. campaign to Russia, including the now discredited Trump Tower Hotel.‚Äù  As initial reported by @HuffPostPol and many others, a total ‚ÄòLiddle,‚Äô covering,‚Äù never ending Witch Hunt!
What are the Democrats doing that caused this big scandal? Why aren‚Äôt they talking about the fact that thousands of illegal illegal votes happened in the Senate. During primary season!
The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!
Just landed in Bedminster, New Jersey with @FLOTUS Melania. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:20 A.M. Enjoy!
Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen‚Äôs new book, given to publishers bc elections are rigged & corrupt. Been using his wife as a robot on lawfare. Never once asked her to read it. @ByronYork @LouDobbs  So terrible!
Mike Pompeo was never given or shown a Transcript or Document by the DNC or any of the participants in the Crooked Hillary probe. That is a total fraud! DNC & Guccifer 2.0 hacked emails CONNECTED TO CROOK HILLARY!

Is the Fake News Media starting to notice that my use of social media is actually good for the #NoKo deal with Kim Jong Un? Let‚Äôs see!
Iran has discovered nukes that can be used for destructive purposes. Chuck and Kerry have failed and now they just sit back and let world suffer!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has stupidly used the 1% campaign slogans and images so many times - only the worst!
Thank you, Brandon!

Gina, Sean & Don‚Äôt let the Fake News tell you that I didn‚Äôt use Social Media, No. The Equation, with its ‚Äúsleazy‚Äù lead, did. Remember when they said I didn‚Äôt have Twitter because I don't have it (wrong again)‚Ä¶
#SouthCarolina ppl want Gov.Johnson, Sen.Graham to be sent to Outer Banks for FEMA, first responders, and all signs are that 200,000 people are asking for help. We need leaders who know how to get the job done!
I'm going to Iowa today- see you there!
Schumer, who hasn't worked in many years, is hurting the Republican Party just by having let it down. It is going to hurt the RNC, which has been working so hard to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, by having a hard time getting along with the Democrats. Dem politicians are just obstacles in the road - weak and very sad!
Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush are broken. Too bad!
Entrepreneurs: Follow your instincts, sometimes intuition may be better. Without instincts, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
If the Democrats in Congress think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, and then come back for full reconciliation, they are entitled to a= review. Our record crime rate is higher than any other major country!
Actually, Mexico will make a GREAT COUNTRY!
They made up sick polls-Why is she so popular? Why is she funny? Old institutional bias?

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
I have not used the phone in 4 years because of the Iran nuke deal, the war in Syria and the economy. By the way, 9 out of 10 people think this deal is terrible. The people get it, and the Republicans want a little flexibility. They can make a deal with us and be done!

Why didn‚Äôt the failing @WSJ call for comment and clarification on the "unfair competition" of Apple and Google? Being able to "do a better job" is the real issue. @JebBush has been like a dog in heat with no head & no soul!
My conversation with @Macys CEO's Ken David and Erica Machado was long, friendly, and very much in the spirit of working toward something. This is a very American company!

Ted Cruz has gone negative on me, for different reasons. He doesn't like the fact that I am the only one who brings jobs back home. Bad optics!
From the day I announced I was running for President, we have had the worst trade deals ever with many countries that we would otherwise treat fairly. The U.S. has taken in billions of dollars over the last decade from these countries, not for our own good! At the same time, jobs are leaving and we have a deep economic  problem. Thu, B3!
Congresswoman Maxine Waters is a total waste of time. Always loud, loud, and very correct. Ralph Northam would not let her get close to him!

The success of @CNN, which is dying in an unfair and dying industry, is being used by other networks that are much worse. Where are all the great new Network News programs by @FoxNews on the destruction of independent CNN - bad programming?
Even the @WSJ editorial said there is "no path to victory for Trump." Sad!
The failing @nytimes exclusively uses unnamed sources and/or people with knowledge of Trump, while the rest of the media, including myself, know far more about FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe (Comey), Kathleen Willey (Lynch), the so-called ‚Äúherd,‚Äù of which there are many, and far worse!

Robert Mueller had his chance and didn't play it. The people know this, but having made a fortune in the process, totally respected. At some point people will start to understand what a total sham the Witch Hunt is - a total scam!

I want to know, where is the money for Border Security, as Dems are now complaining, going? My deepest sympathies go out to the Maricopa County Sheriff, [email protected] ‚ÄúAll I hear is that the Dems are mostly concerned with Corruption and Incompetence. They don‚Äôt want the USA. If they can‚Äôt fix the worst Dem policies & laws in Country history, they will NOT afford the Wall.‚Äù Congress must fix policies & laws!
He will never be able to run the Government, knows Nasty Jared, & has not the mental capacity to do so. Terrible Governor!

Just had a very long lunch with a bipartisan group of legislators concerning serious problem of MS-13 gang members in border. Problem is HCare is unraveling, as I have been saying, badly. Can‚Äôt believe any of them want victory for Trump. Gang will fix, stop drugs & deport all gang members!

As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, yet again, the Southern District of New York. These are just the beginning, far more to come!
‚ÄúThat's one of the dumbest things imaginable, the president saying that it doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Actually, it does - it is so bad that, if there was ever a time, it was that Hillary was so bad. It really is that bad. People have no guts!

Senator @BillCassidy of Mississippi has been a great help to me in so many ways. First, he was a great supporter of the Tax Cuts, and they will soon be making a big win in the Senate - very exciting! Second, he is a great guy who loves our Military and our Vets. Vote for Bill next Election!
Yes, they are trying to do a major shutdown. We are going to WIN! That‚Äôs all they know how to do!

More corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, DOJ and Justice. Steele told me he was under investigation for his paper trail stopping my campaign. He got caught in so many lies - witness? No wonder his so-called love letter to Crooked Hillary!
Ryan Lizza of The Washington Post is the greatest President ‚ÄòI‚Äôve ever seen. He goes around telling me how great my Presidency has been, and I agree. Nobody has ever made a deal better than this Administration. Never been more successful than it is - and the only way to get there is with our great Congress and Government. Never had better!
Thanks, Jonty!

On this Vietnam War, there was no analogy to the past, and we mourn the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The fact is that President Obama held up the very important and sacred Trident missiles in Europe, sending them to Russia, and when he expected them to be cut in half after the Russian Witch Hunt, he got them. He never liked them. They are impenetrable. Like steel, like aluminum! Bad!
if the A.G. has that information, they should share it with the Presidential Advisory Commission on Elections (later this year).
Once again, the Obama Administration is interfering in our personal life and affairs. This time with unprecedented reach and might. The fact that it took Obama so long to make up his reasons for having fired the FBI Director, totally ungrateful!

While in theory it is legal for a government official to ‚Äúbreach the law‚Äù if doing so is in the best interests of the United States. For those days when you can legally break the law, just remember, there is always a great chance that Presidency will be stolen!

Nikki Haley has been telling us how great a deal we are going to get for Israel if the ‚ÄúPharma Whale‚Äù of a man named Robert Phinney or the other high taxes & regulations, Larry Cohen, never uses his last name on anything relating to the negotiations, which is bad news, because they were so crooked and bad for Israel!
The Radical Left Dems strongly told the Republicans in the House not to bring the Haqqiq and All Blacks back or to bring the Sixteen Brave ‚Äî they would be killed. They wanted to use the 15 Angry Democrats. The Republicans understood, and they don‚Äôt forget, that Democrats are in charge and not always kind. But they fought for these horrible crimes!
This is the real truth and everyone can agree it, together with the Dems, must never be allowed to happen to another President!

The problem with big Trade Deals is that they are often accompanied by massive and sometimes fraudulent Tariffs. These were accompanied by massive and sometimes fraudulent Trade Tariffs, and it is only getting worse. Sorry, we knew it was bad when we signed NAFTA 20 years ago, and it got worse with the World Trade Organization ruling!
Democrats are now trying to repeal the lovely Refugee Childhood Protection Act that was signed by me. I am sure they will have to wait until after the election to take heart!
In the course of my career, and in some cases, even in my first term in office, I've given a lot of money to politicians who promised I wouldn't. Sad. Sometimes you have to wait until the end of the year!

The daughter, who may be a controversial person, of Robert Mueller, too stupid to know what is going on with the Democrats - so badly ‚Äúpureed‚Äù for publishing the completely discredited Dossier. It got perfect circulation, little cred. Size & content may be too much for some. Shame!
The Media (Fake News) is going ‚Äúbust‚Äù on the story that I proposed a government shutdown in August. This was a one way street. I was against the Stop Obama unconstitutional amnesty. Media is not as concerned about the debt ceiling. VOTE TODAY!
Great evening in Melbourne, Florida with incredible Patriots- thank you!
‚ÄúThey have no idea what a bad job the FBI did on the Trump 2016 campaign. In fact, the Mueller team, having spirited away their files from Hillary and the FBI, I don‚Äôt think any of them do. Is it possible that they had the Foreknowledge of the Hoax?‚Äù Trey Gowdy
Bob Hugin, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has experienced first hand the terrible specter of North Korea‚Äù said Rep. Kevin Yoder. If President, I hope the Democrats give Bob a hard time in the 2018 Election. His time will come!

TAX CUTS are coming along in tremendous numbers. All said in agreement last week at United Nations. Great support. We will bring about historic tax cuts which, when complete, will unleash American energy IMMIGRATION. Single payer insurance plan, sold through economy, went into effect today!
Self-funding means that Republicans in Florida can stop Lockheed Martin (which is moving to Mexico), which is in a tough fight with Foxconn (which is building a new $15 BILLION facility in Wisconsin). Dems in other words, Republicans in Florida are for jobs and FREEDOM!

China just announced that the U.S. Economy grew at the 3.1% rate during the quarter. That's good, but remember, we have just imposed Tariffs on them! That means a lot of new trade. Crooked Hillary says she's going to raise taxes, rig trade deals, and blah blah blah blah...BUT I will lower taxes!

I agree and it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. The USA has let too many bad countries and bad people into our country and there shouldn‚Äôt be any more govt. in U.S. history than the destruction of the Treason case against Crooked Hillary. The bitter taste of that should not be allowed!

It is becoming more and more obvious that the real Collusion with Russia was between the Trump Campaign and Russia. There was no Collusion. The Witch Hunt is Rigged!
Fun to watch Goodale, Carl, Jeff, Husband and wife Melania. The Impact Factor is @CNN, not @FoxNews. Crazy network ratings, low ratings candidate Shepard Smith. No magic wand, people!
I am now engaged in very important negotiation with South Korea. Talks going on today at U.S.  Diplomat with King Jong Un. I met Prime Minister @Kim Jong Un yesterday. Both yesterday and today. Good news conference soon after we complete our traditional meeting. We will be holding a Summit in Singapore on North Korea THUNDER!
If Bill Clinton is President and has broken the law 30 times, how come he is President? How come the economy is booming, jobs are pouring back, and crime is going down? Because he was President!
As a candidate, I promised we would build a great wall on the Southern Border. Mexico has just agreed to begin the wall. It will, and totally protects the United States - 100% . This is a great thing for the U.S.!‚Ä¶

Wow, just learned in the New York Times that @CNN, which is very pro-Trump, did not call to inform me that they were ‚ÄúFinal Cutters.‚Äù Surprised, but still, why are they the only ones AVOIDING our country, and seeing as how badly our country is treated, compared to the scene!?
VOTE TODAY! Washington Can Replace Washington!
Jeb's big day in South Carolina yesterday, too big to miss.
With airplane fuel being $300/gallon (fortify!), not fair to fly without!
House Democrats are working hard to get a massive Tax Cuts Bill ready for vote before Christmas, when we celebrate 400 years of American prosperity. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lower rates for working families, and millions of Americans rosier than ever before!
Third rate Senator Elizabeth Dole, sometimes known as "Pocahontas," spent millions for an Ice Cream Stand at my rallies only to later claim that Trump won the¬†Bowl. Highly Unprofessional!
Great work being done by @FLGovScott today at the Governor‚Äôs Mansion in Jupiter. Incredible evening with friends and loved ones!
Both the Senate and House must go to a 51 vote majority. Under these tough circumstances, majority, when you need it, is very much like 50. VOTE REPUBLICAN!

Dear @CNN:  Because of the Democrat Media push, conservative news is nearly DEAD on CNN. Why would you watch a biased show (fake) about me when you don't have any facts on Clinton. Should be tested on nuclear launch?

‚ÄúThe real ‚ÄòStarving Patriot‚Äô is the one who is grasping at some portion of power in a country where that power is being lost.

The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have bad experience reporting the news, have ZERO access from the Trump Administration. They are overwhelmed with hatred and bias. #HUGE round of Demotivational Suppression!
#TwitterHas FAST responded to the Department of Justice (and FBI)allegations that it did not stop the massive Pardons and Deathssche Massacre . . . with the likes of these lawyers, massive delays. Still not happy with Pardons!
Billions of dollars are yesterday's bills? Global Warming is a nice bonus!
Watched MSNBC this morning just as everyone else but feel free to skip to my interview on @Morning_Joe w/ @morningmika. No @foxandfriends or @KatiePavlich. No @GeorgeWill -- boring and not worth your time!
The Self-Made Americans have successfully run our own Country, and have run it successfully for 129 years. But as we get older and less industrious, we see every poll that shows the people getting poorer and poorer, not prosperous and richer! No growth, no jobs, no wealth. Very sad!
Entrepreneurs: Negotiation is an art. Treat it like one.
ObamaCare will explode on Day One, either we change it or we die. Our ObamaCare is dead!

Wow, just learned in NC that Bernie Sanders, the future of our country, is in jeopardy if he loses to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He‚Äôs been fighting her from the beginning.‚Äù @JonesClarence  Should be easy. Can you believe this guy, keep fighting!
Just returned from Asia after eight very successful days. 8/10/16 in Japan, 8/20/16 in Germany, and now in Manila, Philippines‚ÄîWow!

Again, the Judge is biased and sick. The right choice for the U.S. only came about because of the 28 lawyers that worked on the record. Count 'em, 28!
Congratulations to President Michelle Bachelet of Mexico on her big Election victory last night! We will work together to lower taxes, promote industry, and bring in American wealth. We are so much richer because of Bachelet‚Äôs TPP approval!

As I have been saying, and as the Democrats are now saying, YOU CAN'T CURE RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM IN ANY WAY. OF TERROR!
We are winning without the Media. The Ethics process will sometimes require us to WIN with the Media, or to get Team Trump, or Team Obama, to WIN with, or to get Team Clinton, to win in either event. News coverage is often dishonest, tough, or fake. Media talent likes it, rarely both!
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is focused on us (with some Fake News), they should start looking in the New England Zones where the vote was illegally tabulated (Guess I will be suing the DNC soon). Some people voted illegally

The Democrats in Congress are pushing the biggest Tax Bill in U.S. history - by far. It will close many loopholes and be great for all. But the middle class and job producers will be hit the hardest. Try negotiating a better deal!
The Drain The People rally in Phoenix was amazing today. Unbelievable people.
Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'hacker' & 'intel' at FBI. Who is she bringing in? Clinton‚Äôs 33,000 illegally deleted emails!
Despite the Rhetoric, the Bushes will do very little to help! Dem than the level of policy. To the Republicans in the Senate, I say, work hard or sit back and let us do our work. Don't do it for us!

Good Luck Doug!
Our salary should be much higher, our stock much stronger. But our country is doing better than ever before!
#NBCNews should  avoid making too many bad, inaccurate, sources in their news. They are a net recipient of Fake News!
Look at the coverage of the non-Breaking News Democrat story that I agree with. The word "uncomfortable" is not a good word for my family. I have taken many of the phony stories off the front pages. The word "uncomfortable" is just a corruption of two words, SURPRISE!
Is it really possible that the man in the hat, the fabulous Barbara Walters, could have such bad and inaccurate information about me and yet at the same time be able to so accurately and fairly cover me and how I am doing so badly with soooo little coverage? Why no questions? I wonder!
The car whose window is broken, the fake messenger, must pay dearly. If I become the POTUS, they will be forced to defend my policies even in the face of extraordinary lobbying and money!
A great senior in the Army who was just demoted (conference call) is now telling the media that I gave a very nice letter to Ivanka, and she didn‚Äôt reply. Looks like a coverup by them!

Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero grasp on the issues. #Debates2016 #BigLeagueTruth #debatenight
The real question, as always, is, WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP IT? Well, here are a few ideas: -Congress must demand that the WH declassify and make publicly available the heavily redacted court papers relating to wiretapping Trump Tower. This is a scandal! Demand for transparency comes from all.  -Congress must demand that the Department of Justice provide the House with all materials relating to the FBI's illegal wiretapping campaign. Justice should be ashamed of itself. Shame should also come to those in power!

The Dupes are much worse for Hillary than Crooked!
Highly respected Senator Bob Corker (won big fight)- amazing guy!
Mark Penn  ‚ÄúI would be surprised if the FBI fired Bob Mueller.‚Äù I thought that, but the Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by all Republicans & Democrats now, seems intent on destroying the Report. Major Fraud by Courthouse News Service, the Competent Reporters, and the Fake News Media!
We now have confirmation that the Obama FBI ‚ÄúSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT.‚Äù Andrew McCarthy says, "I think from reading the transcript, it sure sounds like a presidential campaign. It certainly looks like a different kind of intrusion than the FBI says...." Furthermore, according to the Washington Post, the FISA court got it wrong: "President Trump....could have been secretly watching Cuban food for days." A mess!
Such a wonderful article by Elaine Quijano. "100 years ago: Mexican-American relations are at an all-time high" @FoxNews
The United Kingdom today announced it plans to increase the value of its pound against the dollar. This is in response to the U.S. decision to increase its Sterling Sterling Sterling exchange rate.

Thank you very much, Piers, results will be announced soon. This is a MOVEMENT!
The press is so ‚Äúfascinating‚Äù to find out that Trump U, the anti-Trump Doral student body and so successful, is also deeply Jewish. Truly dishonest journalism!
People are grateful for the great new book‚ÄîTHE FIELD OF FIGHT‚Äîgo out and get it today ‚Äì a great new book by two very respected pros!
Steve Bannon was a tough guy, but his future is National Security Adviser (N.Y.gov. safe), a fantastic position! He was a tough guy, and will be, great guy!

Will the Democrats back off of Border Security and end the Loopholes & Asylum? Would be so easy! In order to make a deal they have to go through the process, which is a LIE!

Real news from CNN, NBC & ABC is bad. They are finally doing Prisoner Impact stories that show Trump‚Äôs record on crime. It is based on unnamed law enforcement which also makes Trump G.Q. profile sitewide-unavailable. No confirmation of any such meeting!
Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!

Congratulations to @FoxNews for the great ratings and ratings increase upped last night from your annual report. Fox will very likely have a very large increase in profit next year. Get serious

Did Crooked Hillary Clinton's Campaign And Supporters Know That Private Emails Were Hacked? #BigLeageTruth
‚ÄúPresident Trump received a B+ for honesty in his business dealings. He dished out the 5 A‚Äù although he didn‚Äôt like the verdict.‚Äù Michael Cohen - The Clintons go to Washington in June, based on the corrupt & compromised Mueller Witch Hunt, will be in hiding for a while!

Wow, North Korea just test fired yet another ballistic missile. 400 miles and passed!! But they still haven't figured out a way to denuclearize. They are very unhappy with the status quo. I understand. I also understand, very strongly, that, if and when the two countries make a deal, they would like it to be very good!
"@assassinscanners45  Why do people listen to you when you are blind to facts? You got no brainpower! Love getting them off the hook." Thank you @megynkelly
We ship some of the greatest business equipment anywhere in the World. Amazon is fighting big tax dollars to take advantage of U.S. We defeat them on jobs and factories all over, in this GREAT U.S.A.

Fight hard and be smart! Don't be dangerous!
Good luck to the @USNavy and their wives on this great day, and THANK YOU for working hard and never complaining (except for those Dems)!

To the Department of Justice, and the FBI, I have just concluded the Independent Counsel investigation of President Trump. (No charges, by decision of the Department of Justice, although the former deeply conflicted Robert Mueller has some very bad criminal and ethical problems.) I have asked that he complete the review within a reasonable period of time, as soon as the independent group of people (not a single person interviewed) are able to be full and positive partners in our country!

Big day for Medicare! Let‚Äôs fight for it in the Senate, and let‚Äôs make sure it is taken up by the Republicans in the midterms!
Great news for Boeing and companies that are working on new plant in Kentucky (canal) that will then be followed up with a new plant in Florida. Jobs and money to circulation!
An attack ad is cheap and easy to make! The radical left wing media exerts tremendous influence over our government & candidates. Once they are forced to spend money, however, they are forced to respond. Time for Trump to start getting big ratings!
Everybody should now BE CAREFUL and follow the directions of their Federal, State and Local Governments. Always playing defense..Heed the warnings of your State and Local Officials.
Marco Rubio totally sold out to Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat Party. Today he endorsed a man who will represent America‚Äôs Interests in Florida, a great person!
I congratulate the newly elected Republican Senators for holding the unprecedented vote to continue our historic Civil Rights Advancement Act. We must continue to keep up the fight-for all!

Rick Scott has been at the helm of Florida for a very long time. He knows the Game plan, he is tough on crime, is smart on taxes, illegal immigration, supporting our Military, Vets and the 2nd Amendment. Strong on Crime and in Vets, well known for doing the Right Thing. Vote for Rick tomorrow.
In speaking to Governor Mike Parson of Missouri this afternoon. He is in Las Vegas on Wednesday. 44 years of fighting and winning to show how tough and smart pols get, and make, America better. We will knock out Dems in Parson's State. Get out tomorrow!

Wow! Just got word that South Korea will be hit hard by ‚Äúvery powerful, very hard to hit missiles.‚Äù If they are lucky, the North will add a nuclear weapon. DO NOT MISS!
Would be amazing if in the GREAT STATE of MO, where Donald Trump won easily over past two weeks, and where Rage of RNC members was just re-enacted, and illegal recording was happening! Unthinkable.
I applaud Ben Carson for suddenly wanting to negotiate a not very tough and extremely bad-for-us trade deal with the U.S. I would be willing to make a deal that worked both ways, very liberal!
The Democrat Culture Wars have returned. These Are not the Old War, Civil Rights or Tax Cuts Bipartisan, but rather the Deep State's Man Who Lost. For them, specifically, and for our Country, the good of the Party is NOT on hold. Get used to it. Get used to WIN!
Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He's boring & insufferable, helps nobody & is a non-factor!
Our Consumer Confidence Index for the first quarter jumped nearly four points to 99.7, far above Wall Street estimates and well above Wall Street's (worse than Goldilocks) own analysts! YMMV!
I'm with YOU. I will work hard and never let you down. Make America Great Again!
As a nation, we should be proud of our great Football Teams. National Anthem, some things just never change!

Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen‚Äôs new book, given to editors by the publisher nearly two weeks ago. Is this a good book? No, it is bad. This transcript does not tell the whole story of the conversation with the U.S.A.G., which is the name by which he is now known. Did the FBI follow protocol in getting the book, or was it simply returned? Who knows? Perhaps the real scandal here is the leaking of the transcripts, which are being illegally released in such a desperate attempt to discredit a highly conflicted and conflicted Man.

It was GOOD news at the Republican Convention for the first time in decades. There were things, and people, that were said that were very slightly to the left until the speakers had to get back to business. Things were always nice! Don‚Äôt ever hear the media say how good, or how fair, the Republican Convention was. Get used to it, it is replacing the Demo, let‚Äôs make America great again!

Wow, not one Democrat Candidate for President has been able to make the transition from Hillary Clinton to me. Her numbers are so bad, so bad!
Alec Baldwin could be nominated for a Star on Fox News tonight for the great job he is doing on Sorkin. Alec is tough on Trump, shows very little self-control and is so proud of Trump!
The re-election of an Obama approved Criminal Justice (Allegations), Governor @ScottWalker, was the main reason I immediately Caved and Caved again. The people of Wisconsin are smart and they got it all for themselves. They got smart fast!
Wow! An even bigger attack on Israel by ISIS today. I am still waiting for the Democrats to come out and say it!
Watched local news reports of the now-infamous Bushey interview. @seanhannity was horrible!
Democrats don‚Äôt want special counsel to be appointed for the totally illegal Witch Hunt of a political rival, is under way. They have been dragging their game all year long, but now, with a View, they still can't get it done. Do you think they‚Äôre satisfied with what they‚Äôre seeing or would like to see an end to this Witch Hunt?‚Äù Mark Morgan. @OANN @ABC News
I hope the Failing New York Times doesn‚Äôt decide not to publish my letter to China or my call with Kim Jong Un.
Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @GiuseppeConteIT of Italy to the @WhiteHouse! I look forward to joining with Italy shortly!

Great job John!

A big deal that is being reported that the Obama FBI ‚ÄúSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN ESSEX HATE TRAVEL BAN.‚Äù Andrew McCarthy says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.‚Äù If so, this is bigger than Watergate!
Thank you for all of your support! I will be making a major announcement about the future of the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) tomorrow evening at the 13th U.S.I.C.
Do you ever notice these Republican candidates, from both the left and the right,  always wanting to go after Robby Mook‚Äôs wife!
So many great things happening to celebrate our 2nd Anniversary on June 25th! THANK YOU America! #DDay75thAnniversary
The Wall Street Journal just stated that Marco Rubio had 7 supporters, including a 2nd Amendment advocate, who gave him the wrong answers at a town hall. Wrong answers
Seeing as how the now famous Trump Tower Meeting had almost zero media, and yet became the subject of so much Fake News, I wonder if the Fake Mainstream Media will ever report on the meeting (or any meeting) with a Russian!?
Via @washingtonpost: "Donald Trump faces 'unprecedented' pressure from voters in battleground Pennsylvania forum"
Sounding more and more like the Democrats come after the Republican Party‚Äôs Presidential Nomination, so early in the morning and with little to show/believe, will try and make a deal to keep the corrupt and corrupt Sheriff who has made a fortune from Arpaio and R‚Äôs failed and ungrateful MOB law. Not likely!
Thank you @ARealCruz! #VoteTrumpVIDEO:‚Ä¶
Key supporters are already flooding back to Trump Tower. Breaking NEWS - but once the opposition party gets to enter - so what‚Äôs the big deal!
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
We must have security in our country. That‚Äôs why I, unlike the Democrats, want stronger borders and a reinstatement of the DREAM Act. Let‚Äôs just let it take care of itself!
Great statistics! Thank you @EricTrump!

Happy birthday to our GREAT @FLOTUS, Melania!
Come on Charlie, we need you very badly to #MAGA! Our country needs you now more than ever. Don‚Äôt worry, we will get you!
Congratulations to Bill Lee on another great victory in South Carolina. His wife, Carol, will be so proud!
I would like to express my warmest regards & best wishes to all of the victims of the horrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!
When the Democrats go ‚ÄúAll in for California, Texas and California Values, they mean very bad things.‚Äù Their meaning is immeasurable. THQ would be shaking in their boots if they were no longer politically correct!
Stephen Miller, the wonderful head of the N.Y. Times, is in big trouble. Low ratings and no new found affection for him by people unfamiliar (yet) will make folks forget what a terrible reporter he is. His voice, his opinions, can never be heard from the Times. In any event, he is not worth the paper heist!
Thank you @MarkLevinShow ‚Äî a great show! #Trump2016
Some of Hillary‚Äôs Wall Street emails that I have received‚Äîare missing!‚Äù A total Witch Hunt! When will the Networks come clean on the DNC and Debbie Wasserman Schultz? The destruction of the Dems will be the biggest story in the history of our country!
‚ÄúFalse advertising‚Äù is costing Republicans in the 2018 Election. This was a big one, and will be a big one in November. Think what Conservatives are giving to News Networks that will never be given to you. It is time for NBC to clean up its act!
‚ÄúTrump threatens to gut campaign finance laws if Clinton gets ticket to DNC.‚Äù @OliverDAdams  She lost the election but worked hard on corruption!
They making a big comeback!

The question that we must ask ourselves is: WHAT WAS THE OBAMATRADE MOVEMENT? Answer: PREZ. #CrookedHillary
I still don‚Äôt understand why Angela Merkel declined my invitation to visit the White House. I had millions of people in New York, she refused! Why is she on TV doing such a big deal if the visit is not historic? Angela must apologize!
Check out these great facts about the people who helped lead the charge against Crooked Hillary Clinton. #ImWithYou
WAR = BORDER CONTROL!‚Äù This is a defining moment in American History. #MAGA

I am not Cambodian and cannot speak for the people of Cambodia. The photo used is an ugly picture of my great, beautiful wife, Melania. I did not know she was in the photo. I apologize!
From my new online campaign store: Enjoy this special evening & tell your friends & tell the world you are #VoteTrump. You can shop all day & it's your last chance.
When the International Association of Chiefs of Police voted to stand with law enforcement and first responders to the president commented that there was ‚Äúno law enforcement problem.‚Äù @IAACP #Anonymous source has now been disavowed.
Crooked Hillary Clinton made a campaign stop in Hanoi, Vietnam in April. The rally looked more like a that of a political rally than a campaign event. The people got it!
Great! @CharlieBrownNFL let's make America great again!
I hope people will start to look more critically at the Iran deal made by President Obama. His people were very unhappy, and I am glad President Trump is helping!
We are winning and the press is refusing to award victories - sometimes a good thing. So easy!
I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who has caused so much pain and death

I asked Sally Yates to ask her ‚ÄúGovernment Officials to TURN OVER ALL CLEAR RECORDS‚Äù so that we could clearly pursue the facts of the Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign. She was so dead wrong about the crime that it needs a new name. Witch Hunt!

President Obama has been in office for 32 years, and 2016 is his worst year. Watch him!
I had thousands join me in New Hampshire last night for a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rally!The silent majority is not loud and vibrant, it is a movement. We must all get out on November 8th & IMPOSE an American DREAM on a massive scale. The time has come for new leadership!
James Comey just totally exposes the ineptitude & corruption of the Clinton team on emails like NONE of which were investigated. Would not be surprised if the entire Uranium chain is missing or broken. #ComeyTale
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president.  BAD judgement!
Do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when the knives come out, no mention. Unfair and her ratings way down. Protect her by not allowing her to be a ‚Äúface.‚Äù
Remember, Univision apologized!
Big endorsement tonight from the great, and long time Senator from New Jersey, Dean Skelos. Looks like a big day for Democrats, even with Limp Kaine & their anti- Trump Super PAC!
Come on Democratic Governor @MattBevin, you have a big job to do, save lives and $50 million a year to pay for it.
Mitch, don't give up. We still have a chance ‚Äì but let's do it with heart, not with hocus pocus!
I hope they report to me in the Federal Judge‚Äôs records. Almost automatic now. FAKE NEWS!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!
THE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. The hatred & evil will just keep coming. Sometimes big lies!
As Election Day nears, it would seem fitting that Republicans and Democrats unite to pass a new, FAIR and LESS expensive & complicated Immigration Bill...which will INFLUVE Americans & make our Country LESS!
From Day One, I said New Year, because that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all about. We‚Äôre working people, after all - and 2015 was the first year in many decades that our Country had a Pleasure Center and Mall - to successfully raise money for the good of our Country and the World! Thank you, working hard!
Jay Sekulow on @foxandfriends now.
Keith Olbermann on @Morning_Joe  ‚ÄúThis whole Obstructionist move by the Democrats...they are doing. Very cowardly, actually, because they don‚Äôt want Trump to go forward.‚Äù  @seanhannity  Exactly!
Just came out that Andy McCabe (FBI) and his wife, Jill, were secretly working for Hillary Clinton on a hidden ‚Äúgift‚Äù from Russia. Survived the FBI! ‚ÄúGrassy Knoll (Closed).‚Äù @LouDobbs Show, On TruTV
Thank you Fort Lauderdale today- in the morning, incredible crowd. Will be back soon!
Many are saying that the real story that Russia, China and, of course, the FBI are now failing is that the FBI, under so many pressure, never called on President Trump, never called on Steele, never called on Director McCabe, and was never told that Rod Rosenstein was going to terminate the Director‚Äôs license. Very sad!
Cameron. We will work well together ‚Äì the great Commonwealth, Britain, Ireland and now Britain again!
Wow, I don't believe the @CNN Wall Street Journal will ever do its final debate because we are now at 9:00 A.M.
Had great news conference at Trump Tower today. Accused Russia of hacking, CBS just put it on their health care show - Russia, Iran & others. Very unfair & biased!
Wow, @CNN RATINGS HAVE CRASHED  on Kavanaugh. Texas senator has my complete and total endorsement. #SCOTUS
Great job by Texas Law Enforcement and First Responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy in Mesa, AZ!

Actually, Iran shot down a drone yesterday - they really want to make a deal with us, perhaps a deal will be made. It is called "the pie" in physics!
Happy Father's Day! A wonderful day for all, especially the millions of wonderful men and women who have devoted their lives to the fight against the terrible scourge of poverty, hunger and starvation. America sets the example!
Iran calls up the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention to say that they purposely caused death & enormous disease throughout Iran by carrying out their nuclear program. These acts were by people that we NEVER heard of who caused the problem in the first place. We are working hard!
Great article by a player I respect greatly, @DLoesch!
‚ÄúFamily members have told me that the son is doing very well. After what happened to his father, I hope the Russians or some third party (not Trump) don‚Äôt have anything to do with it.‚Äù @kilmeade  Wrong! Thank you Maggie Haberman on @foxandfriends.
What an evening! Thank you West Virginia- see you in a few hours!
The Caravan is a major cause for concern as it tries to make the difficult, long and dangerous journey from Mexico through the United States en route to our corrupt and heavily armed Caravan Enforcement Office in Honduras.

Meetings with North Korea are going well, paying great regard to the evolving Nuclear Deal. We have agreed that, when appropriate, sanctions will be increased. Production and Commerce will be resettled. Problem is, if there is no deal, there is no deal. U.S. becomes a net importer of Sat. Time!
These Whopping Taxes were paid by Grover Norquist, who has lost all credibility with his fraudulent campaign to elect many politicians who have raised taxes substantially higher. Grover should step down as a member of the Politicianship - or be immediately replaced. The people will give him hell!

Phyllis Schlafly: You Can‚Äôt Keep a Woman Down
The "Cant Win Win" message, so often used by Dem politicians, is another Dem lie. The Democrats thought they were taking the White House from the Republican Party, who were fixated on the fact that the election was illegally being illegally tampered with. Eventually, largely because of the Rigged Witch Hunt, the Dems will be pushed around!
Thank you Dallas, Texas! Will see you soon! #TRUMP2020

What a blatant attack on our Country, caused by a dishonest newspaper, who tried desperately to peddle the Russian Collusion Delusion story as fact, is how the Dems got the Senate. The Fake News hates this win!
Great news. @FoxNews (8:00 P.M.)  #MAGA is doing really well. Castro doesn‚Äôt have the strength, power or mind to run our Country!
The Democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken, and very dumb, Immigration Laws. Calling all dangerous criminals immediately. They save so much time and money on average, in the form of that horrible Crime Bill. Don‚Äôt let your loved ones die!

So sad! Our beloved Country has been divided for decades-old wounds that cannot be healed. We must come together as one!
Bob Mueller was a terrible choice for the people who ran the FBI. Christopher Wray, a man who has been working long hours for very low pay, is far better suited. I had ample time to find and fire people, slow it down and make a much bigger mistake. The ball is in the direction of the great people who work in the FBI, many of whom have handed it down for years!
Good deal on the border!
Using the 5th Circuit, @SECJustice Kavanaugh can rule on our nation‚Äôs WORST excesses on the Border - when our Country openly enslaved. Should be an embarrassment to the U.S.A!
Albert Goren, for a change, is not confined by the 4% never ending McCain campaign finance report. In fact, according to my check converted into an honest dollar amount, he lost by a lot. McCain, after all of this time, is very easy!
Great news out of Israel. I all out asked Prime Minister @AmmenOved for a really nice letter from him. I got one that was much longer than I ever expected. Thank you Ammen!
Not a problem. Our Country is doing great companies like Adidas and Unilever great things. People that have left and are feeling left behind, or worse, want something to happen. Film The Deal
Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition!
‚ÄúObstruction of Justice‚Äù @SenMarcGoldberg of California when he was a very great Senator. Something tells me he is going to miss this opportunity to be a great Senator. He is such a contradiction to the other side!
But Social Media had better start working properly with China than Vietnam, North Korea or the other countries that have held the Fake News hostage. After hundreds of millions of dollars and many lives, our Failing News Chokepoint deserves a raise. Much more to come.
The Dallas Stars, despite scoring a PP in OT, lost 3-2.They were down 2-0 after the Intermission. Unacceptable!
Governor @ScottWalker has done a great job representing the people of Wisconsin. Our U.S. Senator, Ron Johnson, is a far better representative of the people of Wisconsin. I am glad that the people of Wisconsin will have Ron in office! #MAGA
Brilliant future Supreme Court Justice SCOTUS Justices would vote to end the big costly and politically complicated medical marijuana lawsuits against the states that allow it. Should be able to do so, very quickly!
National Review @NRO apologizes for similarities in theme and name to Trump Haters Magazine. We never meant to offend. Stay true to yourself!
Spied on Trump Campaign, my campaign, and their calling card is my social media. Why is no-one talking about this? Why are so many people signing up for my campaign? Why is my account down? You decide!

#AmericanWomble #AFBFeaturing... A wonderful evening with our heroes from the past.
I've long been in favor of going to war with Iran. There never was a time like the present and all I hear is that one of the reasons the Obama Administration (starting with the disastrous Travel Ban) has failed so badly is that Iran got‚Äôt my message. Too bad!
It is important to remember that Crooked Hillary Clinton defeated Bernie Sanders handily in the W.H. Pick your fork reward for the nomination. Also, Bernie signed the agreement!

Democrats in Congress must respond to the unmet constitutional duty by Republican Senators to give the White House an immediate Clean Slate Makeover.

Russia did not HARM our presidential campaign, and neither has the Failing New York Times. Their story of Collusion is a made up fraud. It was a made up FACT, like many other false and phony stories about me, by Failing New York Times writer Maggie Haberman. She will now find another hotel.

Wishing everyone a safe and Happy New Year!
It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have agreed with our National Intelligence Estimate that North Korea‚Äôs actions are highly concerning. I will seek congressional approval to further increase the Sanctions by December 2019 (ending my Presidency). This is a strong move to reduce the threat from North Korea while at the same time greatly lowering the cost of doing business with North Korea. Going in the right direction!
Very interesting!

The real story that Congress should be discussing is why the Democrats, long before I even got nominated, wanted to put up a $50 million Republican candidate in Missouri, much bigger R‚Äôs than those that are now in office.

Deroy Murdock: ‚ÄúThe major takeaway for me is that the Whistleblower ‚Äòlined up closely with the investigative ‚Äòteam.‚Äù Why is that? Rigged investigations? How bad can it be when the truth is so corrupt? The truth is corrupt because the system is totally rigged! The system is rigged!

If Republicans don't give us the votes to pass great Immigration Bills for the people of our country, we will lose both in 2020 and in the Senate.
This is an outrage. We can and must fix our broken & very stupid Immigration Laws now, before it is too late! We must, & do, build the WALL! Dem Senator Schumer just voted against Homeland Security!

‚ÄúThe Trump Economy, in tandem with historic TAX CUTS, has dramatically raised incomes for millions of Americans, including the working poor.

Why isn‚Äôt Hillary explaining the FBI and her server security classification level, "significant" -- the DNC and Podesta server are much more "sensitive" than "classified." Poor for judgment!
Hillary said she is in "very bad shape" at a news conference today. As usual, she is lying. I am in very good shape, and look good in the polls!
Do the Democrats really want to give Common Core a shot because, believe it or not, some of their own people think it is a terrible idea? I am not buying their "school choice" plan so badly.
So true Dave!
36% of Americans want the Democrats to stop investigating President Trump! That means that, at the end of the year, there will be 37 votes in favor of Tax Cuts/Reform, far more than the 38 needed to get Healthcare passed!
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. What was so sacred? The World loves her.
Why should I be defending a fraudulent Russian Witch Hunt when they were going on from the time Obama won, & the debate was meaningless & unhealthy. If I am not a big fan of Trump & the Democrats, then Trump should not defend them in court!

Good news, Barack Obama thought Hillary had the audacity to be president!
Even Henry Kissinger couldn't have done what I was able to do for the two days I was with John Kerry. I‚Äôm sure, if I‚Äôm with John, it will not have worked. Democrats are very obstructionist. I don‚Äôt know how they got there, maybe they will never get out of office!
We are doing great Economically, Strong Military and will ALWAYS have a strong Military. Our Vets are not happy that we are spending so much time fighting for so little. We have already done a lot to STOP the massive Budget Burdens. Stop big cuts!
I'm closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela and will be doing my best to help. Humanitarian crisis!
Just got word that our once great Commerce Department, one that could have never been rebuilt like clockwork, has been dissolved into the Treasury! A great day in D.C. for Amazon and a big loss for our beloved USA!
Great news! When will CNN do a segment on Hillary‚Äôs plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
The State Of The Union speech was the least boring I have heard in many years. Other candidates have gone on and on, probably hoping to be the next president!
Rupert Murdoch is for Trump, as is his son, James. Apologize to America‚Äôs @HowardKurtz!
Ted & lowlife sleaze David Nakamura, two clowns!
Republicans must change the subject from the highly illegal Witch Hunt that we have been enduring for a long time. It is getting old. We have gotten used to watching. The people get it!
If major decisions on DACA are made before we have a very clear idea of what is happening, the bad DACA deal will be totally reversed. Should be terminated after deal is made!

My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Brian Kilmeade. He went to do very big interview tonight at 10:15 of the evening on @foxandfriends but we get so many good polls for Trump. Why didn‚Äôt Censure him?
‚ÄúVladimir Putin is not being irrational to the Donald Trump economic and national security.‚Äù @LouDobbs  @AlanDershowitz If it were up to me, the KOREAN WAR would have never ended. In fact, the Democrats would have extended it by orders of magnitude. Their were no consequences. How about them?
‚ÄúWe will find out who was in the back of the plane. There‚Äôs probably no way around that.‚Äù @LindseyGrahamSC  @foxandfriends  So true!

Brett Kavanaugh is very angry that his so-called "best friend" from high school, Adam Scott, is now a Kavanaugh accuser. Brett is angry that Brett is now a witness against him.

Our great VETERANS are being shafted by the Democrats in Congress right now. Many of our great vets are balking and refusing to give us the money to fix the problems they have caused. The DEMS in charge do nothing. More must be done. END!
When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus, the Independent Senator from California, who got your money, and the guy who signed the Omnibus Bill) who felt that Bill should not be allowed to be made public. It is a long and politically dishonest process. Best results will be had by Congress.
Presidential Harassment!

New Hampshire has been won by Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. I gave them a hard time in the last debate. They will never be taken seriously as a political party!

Billions of dollars are spent on Baltimore every year, mostly to fix Baltimore's not very good transit system. Moved to rebuild and get country back on right path. $25 million for rebuild, all paid for by me. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if every community in America could vote for their next mayor so that city could be rebuilt with money coming from me!
Of course the Stock Market is doing well. People don't want to trade off ANT's!
Why didn‚Äôt the bipartisan Gang of Eight just give us the desperately needed Border Wall & now it is time for a Wall in Congress (in NY & MD already under construction). Wall is a good thing that will save lives! @RepCummings
President Assad of Syria, by my agreement, must acknowledge his responsibility for the horrible chemical weapons attack.

Compared to what the teams of both the Democrats & Republicans in Congress have done in terms of Border Security & the Wall, the hiring of Ford, now, with its acquisition by Trump, is a great result.

The Mainstream Media has never been more corrupt than it is today. Stories and reporting that never before in history had FAKE news ‚Äî collusion with Russia (Clinton & FBI), Russian visit, Russian Hurley (CO), Russian Meddling, Russian HELP, Russian ME. I call BS!
The failing @nytimes has entered the Trump Country (Hall of Fame) lunacy. Their coverage of me is never more extreme than when interviewing me, usually 3 or 4. They had no interest in our great conversation!
The investigation of Clinton and the controversy over ‚ÄúShadow Campaign‚Äù is totally conflicted in nature. There was no collusion and, in fact, many people that got the Russia Collusion Delusion. The Witch Hunt had no basis in fact. #CrocDay

If the Democrats in Congress don‚Äôt give us the votes to change our weak, overly generous, dangerous Immigration Laws, we will be forced to use something far tougher on the Border, and political pressure will be building.

‚ÄúBob Mueller was not authorized to investigate President Trump.‚Äù There is no such statute. There is a Section of the Criminal Law that says you cannot investigate it (unless it is specifically authorized by Congress), and that is why it was never used. (as seen in the investigation of Crooked Hillary Clinton.)
So sad that members of Congress are not protecting their District & State from the Radical Left Democrats who want to take it away. We are fighting to give it back!

Russia started their campaign to reduce uncertainty in the marketplace, to the detriment of the banking system and to the detriment of our great Farmers.

We must maintain a HIGHRIGHTed immigration system. Mexico, Canada, and others rush the market. Dems opposition is a national disgrace! Purposes and measures must be secured.
Ted Cruz did not disclose that he will be using the very old, very quiet, and often panned ‚ÄòPhone Register.‚Äô That is a very big violation. Ted says he will clean up some things but the fact is that he will not. An absolute disgrace to our system!

There‚Äôs someone right now feeding the Intelligence Information (Russia) to the Fake News Media, and the Senators and others (Fake News) that are Drafting the Tampering Congressional Inquiry (No Collusion).

Watched negotiations yesterday with North Korea but can‚Äôt make a deal. They have been tough but, at some point in time, will be forcing me to make a very big Negotiations Event in Israel.

Crooked Hillary Clinton forgot to mention Ron Dellums, who was the 9th Circuit Judge who gave her a pass in the FBI decision not to Report Missing Emails. @FoxNews should spend more time on her racist and anti- Hispanic statements & the fact that she deleted 33,000 emails AFTER getting the questions!

Wow, Mitt Romney just said that I fired the head of the FBI, a big lie. Remember, the head said there was no collusion with Russia, there was no collusion with Russia, and there was no quid pro quo!
A great representative of the people!
So @CNN made up a story that I wanted to his tweet, then directly asked me to take a question from him. So weird!
36 year low in new jobs! Only millions of jobs get created in this country!
This agreement is so good for the U.S. as a whole. It ends the ridiculous dragnet at our border and totally protects our farmers and manufacturers. Great for our economy!
I have been using Social Media (and, in recent days, real estate) to engage people as opposed to just writing them check for $20,000. I will win. Watch!
The Opioid Crisis hits our Nation hard. We must act NOW. Let us all know today that we are fighting hard to save $25 Billion a year, and it‚Äôs not happening! Congress must act NOW!
Why aren't they bringing in Arnold Palmer for the debate. He doesn't have the strength or stamina to be our president. LameStream Media!
What a ridiculous distraction @CNN makes in their favor on the debate stage. @CNN is always negative!
The Democrats made up and falsely used the biggest story in the world, the story of the Russian Ambassador,  Brian Hale, meeting a woman called "Natalia," who may or may not be a Russian spy. This is the total and complete Witch Hunt. But it was a Democrat made up, old story!
‚ÄúKey players in the announcement are still unknown, mostly for reasons of security clearance. Some U.S. officials, however, know who they are.‚Äù John McLaughlin, National Security, Dept.

Wow, injustice has been done to Nancy Pelosi & Peter King. The Radical Left Dems branded Peter ‚ÄúKing first class citizen.‚Äù Would have a tough time proving that.

With the cheap shot that Crooked Hillary took at me, and the unfortunate decision she makes, I wonder if the FBI or DOJ would take the extraordinary step of reopening the case - if they even still exist. What a disaster for USA!
There was no Collusion with Russia (so phony), there was massive leaking and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. Why is Crooked Hillary getting millions from foreign countries?
Well, after two great weeks of polling, New Hampshire and California, Carson is in second place and Bush is in first place...but with a force multiplier of 3,600!
If the winning candidate in Virginia is not Corey Stewart, and if our great VETS were not told by the media that their FUTURE VOTE was in jeopardy, I ask that the heavens open their treasures wide for our great FOUNDERS!
Many people are saying that the Intel Crooked Hillary story is a TOTAL FABRICATION. There is no shooting up in Switzerland, nothing even close. FBI & Russian Hoax totally WITCHED!
Why haven't they asked Debbie Wasserman Schultz about the Dem Convention ‚Äîshe has a duty to support the vets!
FYI- at 1:00 AM EDT, the Washington Post (lobbyist), @JessicaDebSopan, said that "Trump is the greatest President we have ever seen." Thank you Jessica, and please thank Steve Hilton!

Just leaving the Great State of Ohio. Amazing evening with amazing people. Thank you to Mark McKinnon, April 5th
This is real, this is a serious effort being made by @FoxNews to rebuild their badly tarnished and heavily challenged brand through the trapdoors of the old @nbc brand. They do it by putting plain spoken people in key positions, and Social Media falls into new and terrible categories. This will be bad!

It was just amazing to watch Jeb Bush try so hard and to no avail to defend his brother. No character!
Today, GOP Senators updated their long delayed and substantially scaled back Border Security Bill to include the desperately needed WALL. Now the public has 60 days to weigh in on my proposed $22 Billion Wall in Arizona. Time is of the essence!

When a Preliminary Investigation Finds No Collusion, Dems are Gone. Liberal D weasel Jeff Sessions is still a good guy. So unfair to a single person (Sessions).

Once again, Congress must take up our extreme needs for Border Security. Get it done!
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. As I have been saying all along, totally makes no sense whatsoever. A total witch hunt. If Russia did it, it would be called a METAPHOR for the Republican Party!

Boston Globe has the real story behind the EPA deal. It's a disgrace!
The drug companies have attorneys who work for a FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. They do this every time they are sued by the U.S. GOVERNMENT. The great American farmers, however, are NOT represented.

Need all on the UN Security Council to vote to renew the Joint Investigative Mechanism for Syria on 21 August. Joint has been torn up many times in the past. Syria is laughing from the outside. It is desperate!

Murder charges should never have been brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. So many witnesses, so much evidence. What ¬≠Trump said was just ¬≠at the wrong time, in the wrong boat. His statement on the tarmac, by the way, was not true. Collusion?

Mr. Mueller, why didn‚Äôt the Do Nothing Democrats choose some of the great names that were involved in the original Witch Hunt, including Donna Brazile, that were DEMANDED? Why were so many people DEMANDED but let the investigators go through the materials? Why were no people of consequence DEMANDED but the very dishonest and conflicted investigators? Why doesn‚Äôt the person in charge the totally Fake & Corrupt Russia story, the Dems, choose from the many names. Once I pointed this out to them!

Jerry Nadler is hardly an insider, having lost both his legs in combat. His record, even with unlimited money, is terrible. His son, who is Jewish, is far more talented. The Dems are far more concerned with anger than winning. Sad!
Great day of negotiations with North Korea. The first summit was amazing. U.S. and South Korea will be far safer together. It is only going to get better!
Also, the departure of Michael Cohen is a disaster for the wider political world. He represents a massive void of judgment that I will fill, together with our enormously talented new Attorney General, by far the best qualified and experienced people.

Loved being at Calexico Convention Center yesterday! Over 400,000 people there- many thousands of cars. Thanks Trump Haters all over!
Wish Obama would release his long time conservative friend, Hugh Hefner, from the Mexican prison where he has been convicted of many horrible crimes. The disgraced former Mayor of D.C.M.H., who asked me for help with National Review, must be deported immediately!
A talented and determined lawyer should be handling the Trump University suit. Too bad they cannot resolve this case. The total fraud against Donald Trump, and everyone else, is too big to ignore.

Wow, Jeb Bush just flat out lied about my meeting with the Ukrainian President. I couldn‚Äôt have been nicer. His wife's record is suspect!

The Nationals played the best baseball of any team in Game 7 of the NLCS. They hit 12 home runs, no hits allowed, walked two & struck out 11. Elias revealed that Bryce Harper hit at least 12 HRs. Congrats, guys!
I may be at odds with the Failing New York Times (11th person to be fired), but I know they are Fake News after they reported almost nothing but the truth (actually, they are a Dishonest Machine). In any event, I have learned to live with Fake News!

Lying Zionist David Brooks, of the @NYTimes, is ‚Äúlying‚Äù to his magazine when he says that I do not "hate Israel." I "love" it!
Here is my statement.
This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush. His campaign seems to have crashed and burned--he is stuck in the past, can read Al Cardenas tweets without any passion or knowledge, and does nothing to help me out. He is not an authentic conservative!
Anybody who watched all of tonight‚Äùs Super Bowl will say this about Roger Goodell: He is tough, smart, and often just plain LUCKY! In any event, you can‚Äôt beat him, and Russia, at football!
Foreign Minister of Israel of wisdom, Benya Rosen said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter, it wasn‚Äôt about politics.‚Äù I agree. This case is about removing enormous risk to American citizens by traveling to Israel. Brooks should go to Israel, he has no other choice. The horror!

The real surprise in the so-called Russia investigation is the leaking of Classified Information. Why is the information so embarrassing to the highly conflicted Robert Mueller (who was Comey's boss at the FBI)? He has a defiant, defiant mane. A leak like so much more!

Gross misstatements and outright lies by the Fake News Media today. Without a Wall this foolishness would seem almost effortless. 31% of our Country are either unemployed or underemployed, the slow dieing Dems!
Obamacare is dead! Full repeal needed‚Äîgreat coverage gained, massive subsidy payments made, and insurance companies leave!
Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is staying at home & waiting for his father. Disgraceful!
Remember that Hillary will use you, and a lot of people are buying into the Witch Hunt. Ask her supporters to spare us the disgrace of a fourth rate Senator!
Presidents are supposed to get re-elected every four years, not twice!

Tremendous numbers of individuals are claiming pre-Christmas benefits in the United Kingdom as a result of our EUMA and similar EU programs. These large numbers will increase if we get in line with Germany in benefits. Germany is not a functioning country of the EU, and treats its working people very badly. I have therefore decided I will not renegotiate, as has been suggested, but will instead focus on the massive cuts I have requested, as well as the fantastic tax cuts approved by the U.S. Congress!
With all of the illegal acts by Kushner relating to the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax which has now been exposed, some Democrats are still trying to use it as a means to get Trump to stop getting Crooked Hillary Clinton elected!

So why aren't the Democrats helping the Republican Party? Is it because the Republican Party will very well have won all of the Border States (excuse the pun!) in November, 24 years ago? Why no Wall? Why the late, wise and furious move to RAISE TAXES?

Did Crooked Hillary use the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to get the questions to be removed from the Trump Tower Meeting on June 13, 2016? Why didn‚Äôt they use the FBI - largely because they knew the questions would be ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to Rice and the people that she was talking to!  And much more!

Crooked Hillary Clinton simply cannot compete with Trump. She lost the election against disastrously bad Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Why does a losing candidate poll really badly, and then announce that she is running again‚Äîscam!
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. Departed the White House long before she was cleared. BAD judgement!
I think it would be morally reprehensible for the Republican Party, if they are allowed to be nominated, to participate in an after election "resize" that would allow the Republican Nomination to be FULL, leaving open the path to victory in November. Would be totally unacceptable!

Andrew McCabe FIRED, the glorious career of the wonderful FBI Director is now in doubt. ‚ÄúBased on the facts of the case, he posed no risk to national security.‚Äù He was clearly the target of this corrupt & dangerous witch hunt. No charges. Such a disgrace!
In an effort to distract from the so-called "murder" of Justice Kavanaugh,and judge idiotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Dem.)

Join me at the Verizon Wireless Center- Manchester, New Hampshire on 2/3! #FITN #NHCN #NHPrimary
Everyone is pointing to Puerto Rico after a great day on the road to recovery. Pictures and scores of great people. We are in such great shape, but tomorrow is ‚ÄúHurricane Florence‚Äù and weeks ahead!
Thank you to @UnleashingTheAmericanRight and @JoshuaKeating from N.Y.C. for a very fair and professional debate - Thanks!
Thank you Jerome!
Twitter has just stated that they are phasing out fake accounts. This is happening rapidly with the @nytimes being the latest victim. Phasing out fake accounts is a good thing, not a bad thing. Tha√Øs pretty sad that the dying @nytimes will be allowed to remain!
Such amazing and important news and very impressive numbers. Thank you America!#MAGAüá∫üá∏
Again, the President of Ukraine said there was NO (ZERO) PRESSURE PUT ON HIM BY ME. Case closed!
‚ÄúThe winner of the 2016 Presidential Election, with nearly 56 million votes, almost exactly the same person (Huma) is now running against the ENVY for the Presidency.‚Äù @LouDobbs  Haim Saban, powerful Los Angeles lobbyist. Very disloyal to Trump!
I never called the strike ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù from Air Force one at the BORDER. Never even heard of them. Will never happen under my watch. The strike was so badly needed - they were only interested in destruction!
Great job on TV, thank you Rupert. Amazing job!
‚ÄúThe real ‚ÄòMusic City, North Carolina,‚Äù the place I have been waiting all my life, the place where Crooked Hillary was all talk and no action and now is!" Eric Trump. So true, thank you Eric!
These California fires are expanding exponentially, even into California Interior. Law enforcement is on site but, as always, help is on the way. California is a truly great state. GOD BLESS CALIFORNIA!
My @WMUR9 Commitment 2016 Conversation with @LouDobbs discussing the Presidential Campaign, ahead of the Washington @FairVoteLinkEDS precinct:
Via @TheTodaysGolfer‚Äôs  yesterday:The 18 unassuming men & women who have played the game‚Äôs game's game changers‚Äô will join the (@ROCCatCRUZ) team this October. The 64 year old Culinary Academy will be honored once again! Club Canada, Victoria! #CanGCovaTouchPlayers‚Äù
My wife, Melania, will be interviewed tonight by Anderson Cooper on @CNN. This will be the best time EVER! See you on the other side.
Thank you, @foxandfriends!
I am now in New Hampshire. The people have spoken and the event is sold out! Largo dinner at 12:00 - Sold out crowd!
This week we celebrate the contributions of Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders that enrich our Nation.
Jon Kyl will be the next Senator from Arizona.For someone so against the big cuts & Tax Cuts, we need him very badly. Strong on Crime, Border, Military, Vets‚Äîwe need the desperately needed Senator!
Crooked Hillary Clinton knows absolutely nothing about trade. It is a Clinton campaign promise. #Debates2016
Texas: Please listen to the victim in this case, G.T. Duane Washington. Get well soon. We need you!
‚ÄúFake News‚Äù has reached a new low. A total disgrace! Mainstream Media, no source material good or reliable, is my enemy as much as anyone!
#MastersInLaw #MAGAüá∫üá∏
The mainstream media will not talk about the biggest story of our time, the huge police and fire and first responders who are so grateful for having the American people‚Äôs trust!
Hillary asked me to use her email ‚Äòafter the campaign‚Äô began. I said no (then released). Problem is, nobody owns her
Thrilled to have President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine @Macys greet the team at the @WhiteHouse this morning. Great cooperation with Ukraine on the defeat of ISIL. Together, we will‚Ä¶
Thank you Mr. Wonderful, the Debt Ceiling is coming down quickly!
‚ÄúFINDINGS FROM CERTAIN SOUTH CAROLINA‚Äù Covington, Kentucky, July 10-13, 2016. More than 80,000 people turned out. It was an amazing day for North Carolina. Congratulations!
Happy birthday to the future ‚ÄúPhantom Firebirds.‚Äù Their parents should be proud of them. Together, we will continue burning the eff your favorite color, MAGA!!
The Democrats in Congress, long absent, want to impeach our great and brave President, but won‚Äôt give him the time and opportunity to do so. Ryan Zinke is a fine man, and a great United States Senator!
They will never take us on because the Dems are WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, & WEAK on Safety and Security - and yet they love giving us bad advice. We need CONGRESS!
Unforeseen circumstances have caused major disruption to the Runaway Iron Pipeline that runs through our Country. We have decided that we will not build this dangerous and irresponsible project in Indiana, instead focusing our energy and resources on the Southern Border. No new deals made with North Korea!
Felicia Sonoma, who campaigned on a platform of fighting illegal immigration, turned down my invitation almost immediately. When will she turn down the nomination of @HillaryClinton!
If the Democrats really want to protect criminal aliens with horrible criminal records they should vote for Carol Miller and Ray Brewer, not Susan Lynn and Brady Campaign. They are weak on Crime which is good!
#NILationalANarchistPrisonerDay
I hope JEB reads the e-mail controversy‚Äôs that he has just found. Incompetent Libs and such people don‚Äôt deserve good much longer. Much more to come. Bad judgement.
Rusty, a terrific guy, will be a great Governor. Gary is tough on crime and will bring great jobs to Florida. Jerry would be a Great Governor, and I will defeat Hillary easily, just like I have been able to do so far!
Wonderful to speak to--families with great luck tonight. God bless the teams!

Thank you @mike_pence!#INPrimary #VoteTrump
‚ÄúWould show support for border security if the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) would become law.‚Äù @RoyManderson  @JebBush is wrong! DACA is dead. I will fix this problem. The Democrats want open borders!
JUST OUT - thank you, New Hampshire! #VoteTrumpNH
HAPPY 102ND BIRTHDAY to the @USNavy, a truly great group of people! Thank you!
In 2008 Jeff Ashton was badly Dred Scotted by Republicans in his great State of Alabama. Today SCOTUS threw out the original 1857 decision and returned the case to the original travesty of Democracy! I wonder if the Radical Left Democrats will now try and undo what happened here today? No more!
‚ÄúJames Clapper had nothing to show except for his Precedent.‚Äù @GrahamLedger @OANN  @gangcongress Message to Jeff Sessions, have you been under investigation now?
Average Joe & Hillary rated weak shows like Meet The Press and @CNN. Two clowns!
Today I announced my nomination of Jerome Powell to be the next Chairman of the @FederalReserve. Jerome has a tremendous amount of responsibility to serve as Chairman. I look forward to working together with him!
While the focus should be on City Hall now, for a change @CNN @SitRoomCNN will show the Republican & Democratic Joint Sessions with wonderful new poll results! Thank you @StoneColdJoe!
I am truly honored to have received the 2017 @USStateVisitüá∫üá∏. As a longtime friend, I know this State very well & look forward to hosting our wonderful citizens for a short time!
Congratulations to the #GALa and fellow members of my transition team. Together, we will continue making America‚Ä¶
‚ÄúWindsor scandal exposes deep state‚Äù @JesseBWatters By the way, Hillary‚Äôs deep state thugs are the FBI, DOJ, Justice Dept. haters...You have nothing to fear from the police other than what you have done to get rid of them! ‚û°Ô∏è
The Democrats, on Trade, are holding our farmers hostage over Trade in fact, sometimes by shutting down our entire economy. It is about time!
Quiet the fuck out of the White House!
Those that watch closely will notice I stated my choice for Federal Reserve Chairman in Meet and Circuit Committee naturally, Thomas Curry. I hoped he would be a great Chairman because of the potential for economic growth & job production!
Unbelievable afternoon in El Paso, Texas. With our incredible First Responders, Law Enforcement and Border Protection. Thank you. God Bless America!
I am really starting to enjoy the Russia Witch Hunt! Recently the Dems were digging up dirt on a candidate who was then, for various reasons, no longer relevant. Mueller has now recused himself (as has been reported), a huge conflict of interest. Ridiculous!
Having great meetings with my friend @ALG-North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, North Carolina Congress members, and all the many brave men and women working hard on behalf of North Carolina. We are all committed to keeping our future First in the Hands of our GREAT People!
Just out - in Iowa Caucus, Cruz is at 1% -- Rubio at 15%. Not impressive. Best showing ever!
Just spoke to President Macri of Argentina about the 10,000 4 miles SE of McAllen. Total devastation, massive loss of life and tremendous loss of future. I understand the incredible people of the United States are still reeling from the terrible accident!
Thank you @CharlesHurt for the nice words. All the people that attended the WH today want peace through strength & prosperity.
Marco Rubio just lied to a small crowd at CPAC - completely dishonest. People don't like him, or his inadequate knowledge of foreign policy. #debate...
July 4th, 2017 is going to be so exciting! Donald J. Trumpüá∫üá∏ #MAGAüáßüá≤
HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!

The NRA and Ted Cruz have gone totally berserk. They can't control who gets our weapons. Our country is in big, scary, problem!
This week, I will be hosting a big rally for Congressman Dan Donovan at the @WhiteHouse. He has my complete and total Endorsement! He will be a great Congressman for the Great State of New York. You‚Äôve come to love your new Sheriff, Jerry. #NYPrimary
This is just the beginning!
Joe Oliverio completes the struggling @WSJ Editorial Board. No wonder people are tossing and turning from "failing" to "unfair" in the ratings!
The end result will be #MAGA, great healthcare and safety for all Americans. #Trump2016
John Kasich failed badly tonight in the GREAT State of Ohio. His victory was certainly not unexpected, especially after signing a disastrous #09Amendment (L.G. Bill). Vote Kasich instead for lower taxes and badly needed Border Security!
Amazing, and true!
#DrainTheSwamp on the massive inflow of refugees pouring into our country from ISIS controlled areas in Syria!!
Thank you Angel!
People are not proud to be standing on the southern border!
Would be nice if the Radical Left Congresswomen began openly giving the questions for the debate to the Networks and Politicians rather than hiding behind the Women‚Äôs Curtain! Temperatures could be as cold as -20 C! See you tonight Nashville, Tenn!
HAPPY 4TH OF JULIA üá∫üá∏
Thank you so much Cobb County, Georgia! #TrumpPence16
Thank you Media and Fake News London for the wonderful and very interesting conversation last night on @Morning_Joe. Very positive! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
The Republican House and Senate must get together and do a strong border security package. No crossings! Last thing we need. Fix our weak and very PARTNERSHIP dependent immigration laws.
Just got off the phone with Governor Jerry ‚ÄúMoonbeam‚Äù Brown to let him know that we are ‚Äúlow & very low‚Äù on the number of inmates coming across our Southern Border. CRIME!
Congratulations to the Houston @Astros on their @TwitterSportsCentury award.Wow, is this team stacked up big. They will make some history together!
Because there is No Collusion and nobody has been charged related to the Trump Team and Russia (except for the Democrats & the FBI), this Witch Hunt should be ended immediately. We need new Congress to get things done!
Thank you- Keynote Address- at The National Association of REALTORS! #Trump2016 #NAReconnect
‚ÄúConsumer confidence is at a 16-year high. The consumer is spending as much money as they make. The unemployment rate is at a 50 YEAR LOW. The Stock Market has now reached another all-time high. There are lots of new, valuable things to spend your money on.‚Äù Thank you to Steve Moore. @foxandfriends
A Great RALLY last night in Denver, Colorado - THANK YOU!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Crooked Hillary Clintons have hijacked our government & are now under investigation for clearly corrupt behavior. She deleted 33,000 emails AFTER getting a kickback from H.
